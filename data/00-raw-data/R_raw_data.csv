"6","If you're wondering whether to get the new iPhone 15 or save some money by going with an older one, we'd suggest to do your due diligence and research the best iPhone deals around to score you the best bang for the buck for your new iPhone. There are big changes in Apple's latest phones, especially the iPhone 15 Pro models — like its titanium alloy frame, Action button, and 5x zoom camera."
"7","Now that we've put it through its paces, the iPhone 15 Pro Max supplants its predecessor as the best iPhone you can buy right now, but you can choose from other options at a wide range of prices. And our best iPhones guide can find the right model for you, since we've put each one to the test to see what kind of value they deliver for the money."
"8","If you're weighing an iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro decision, it's a matter of deciding whether the Pro models' more premium features are justified by their higher price. iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Plus comparisons come down to screen size preference and budget."
"9","Of course, if it's bargains you're after, you can always turn to an older model with a lower price. The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 13 remain available from Apple. And the cheapest iPhone of all — the iPhone SE 2022 — compares well to our picks for the best cheap phones."
"10","Whether you're a long-time iPhone fan or just making the switch from Android to iPhone, we can help you find a phone you'll be happy to use. Here's how we rank the best iPhones currently available."
"11","Now that they're official, Apple's new iPhone 15 lineup dominates the list. That comes as no shock given how they stacked up during our review process. After the dust settled, it's the iPhone 15 Pro Max that comes out on top of Apple's available phones, with other models at different prices rounding out the rankings."

"55","Who should get the iPhone 15 Pro Max: Anyone who wants the best iPhone around, regardless of price"
"56","Every premium feature Apple packs into its phones is on display with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the phone has the price tag to show it. While this is the most expensive iPhone, you also get the super-fast A17 Pro processor, an improved 12MP telephoto camera with 5x zoom, and an eye-catching titanium alloy frame. Plus, the Pro Max offers an expansive 6.7-inch display with a big battery to match. That battery kept the iPhone 15 Pro Max running for more than 14 hours in our test, placing it near the top of the best phone battery life rankings."
"57","The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s hits keep on coming. The new Action button replaces the mute switch and can be programmed for a number of functions — including acting as the mute switch. Its most notable new addition is its improved telephoto camera range, which now extends to 5x zoom, the longest in an iPhone to date."
"58","We struggle to come up with any serious complaints about the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is not only the best phone you can buy right now, but the best iPhone Apple’s ever made."

"63","The iPhone 15 doesn’t have the flashier features found in its Pro siblings, but it’s still a solid upgrade, particularly if you’re looking to make the move from an older iPhone — we're thinking iPhone 13 or later. "
"64","The notch is gone, and now in its place, the Dynamic Island that it borrows from the iPhone 14 Pro series. The iPhone 15 features an A16 Bionic chipset instead of the newer A17 Pro. But at least the iPhone 15’s version of the A16 features it the extra GPU muscle to boost it over the iPhone 14."
"65","While the 5x telephoto camera in the iPhone 15 Pro Max is grabbing most of the attention, the iPhone 15’s camera improvements are noteworthy — so much so that this model ranks among the best camera phones even without a dedicated telephoto lens, which Apple is able to do with some hardware and software magic. A larger sensor with bigger pixels powers the main camera, improving performance in low light and makes its 2x zoom photos usable. The iPhone 15 also benefits from Apple’s enhanced Photonic Engine, which delivers brighter images. "
"66","Action mode for capturing smoother video continues to be available to iPhone 15 owners, while its new USB-C port allows it to charge all of your other favorite gadgets  — like the AirPods and Apple Watch, And that comes in a device that continues to cost $799, making it one of the more affordable flagships out there."

"71","The iPhone 15 Plus is the best iPhone for people who prefer a larger display but don't want to pay big bucks for one of the best big phones. For $300 less than the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPhone 15 Plus gives you an expansive 6.7-inch OLED screen, whether you want to watch movies and shows on the go or you just want a bigger viewfinder for your photos. And the photos look amazing from the improved cameras on the iPhone 15 Plus, thanks to a bigger main sensor and Apple’s Photonic Engine for better pics in low light."
"72","As much as we like the regular iPhone 15, you’ll want to get the Plus if you want more time between charges. The iPhone 15 Plus lasted over 14 hours on our web surfing test, making it the longest battery life we've tested in an iPhone ever. There’s some things we don’t like about the iPhone 15 Plus — including its dated 60Hz refresh rate and slow charging via its new USB-C port — but overall it’s a great value. And like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 15 Plus is available in a handful of charming color options."

You'll sacrifice battery life — the battery inside the iPhone 15 Pro is smaller — and the Pro model only offers a 6.1-inch display (though it matches the 144Hz refresh rate of the larger Pro Max)."
"78","The A17 Pro chipset is here, as is the improved 48MP main camera. Dynamic Island is borrowed over from its predecessor, but Apple introduces several new changes to make it a refreshing change — like its sturdier titanium alloy frame, programmable Action button, and USB-C port. From cameras to display brightness, to the way it handles demanding apps, the iPhone 15 Pro is a winner, and a way to enjoy the high-end Pro features Apple has added to its lineup without paying Max prices."

"89","Even with the iPhone 15 available, the iPhone 14 remains a viable choice for many people, especially now that Apple's older phone costs a lot less. By skipping more recent iPhones, you won't get a slightly improved A16 Bionic chipset in the iPhone 15 or the camera improvements in the new models. But the iPhone 14 is a worthy upgrade from older phones, and now it costs less than before at $699. (Our iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 14 comparison has more on the differences.)"
"90","One of the best things about this model is its storage — Apple includes 128GB with the base model after years of forcing people to upgrade from the skimpy 64GB if they wanted a higher capacity. The A15 processor remains a solid processor, though upcoming Android devices are likely to out-muscle it if Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 benchmarks are any indication."
"91","As with any iPhone 14 model, the real story here is the cameras. The iPhone 14 still features two rear lenses, but they have bigger sensors than the iPhone 13's, leading to improved low-light photography. The iPhone 14 also supports Cinematic mode for shifting the focus in videos."

"95","Who should get the iPhone SE 2022: Anyone who wants the least expensive iPhone"
"96","The iPhone SE (2022) is the most budget-friendly option in the current iPhone lineup. Starting at $429 for the 64GB model, the latest SE is a veritable powerhouse that runs laps around anything else at this price point. You will not find something that performs better under $500, even if its lone camera loses some luster when compared against the likes of the Samsung Galaxy A54 and the Google Pixel 7a."
"97","With the same A15 Bionic chipset that’s in the iPhone 13 — but lacking the extra GPU core found in the A15 powering the iPhone 14 — the iPhone SE (2022) can handle any task you set before it, all in an incredibly compact body. However, the 4.7-inch LCD is a bit of a letdown with a low resolution by today’s standards (1344 x 750). The chunky bezels of the classic iPhone design also look incredibly dated."
"98","Perhaps the most egregious omission from the iPhone SE is the lack of Night mode. It’s even sadder because the phone takes great photos in daylight. And it also lacks mmWave 5G, so people hoping to take advantage of Verizon’s Ultra Wideband network will be left out in the cold with the latest iPhone SE."

By skipping more recent iPhones, you won't get a slightly improved A15 Bionic chipset in the iPhone 14 or the camera improvements in the new models. But the iPhone 13 is a worthy upgrade from older phones, and now it costs less than before at $699. (Our iPhone 14 vs. iPhone 13 comparison has more on the differences.)"

"105","As with any iPhone 13 model, the real story here is the cameras. The iPhone 13 still features two rear lenses, but they have bigger sensors than the iPhone 12's, leading to improved low-light photography. The iPhone 13 also supports Cinematic mode for shifting the focus in videos."

"107","When shopping for an iPhone, take stock of the features and capabilities that matter most to you. If battery life is especially important, seek out a larger iPhone, as they tend to have bigger batteries to match their screen size. What's more, because iOS is known to be generally efficient in terms of energy consumption, even the smaller models tend to last longer than average on a charge."
"108","If you're basing your next iPhone purchase off camera quality, the top-tier Pro variants are easy recommendations, thanks to triple-lens designs that allow you to capture multiple different perspectives, from zoomed-out ultra wide-angle images to shallow depth-of-field portraits. They're also remarkably good in challenging lighting scenarios, like when shooting in a dimly-lit indoor space, or outdoors at night."
"109","All that said, if price is king, and saving the absolute most on your next smartphone purchase is your top priority, you should have no reservations about nabbing either the iPhone SE or an older model with a lower price tag. They may be on the cheaper side of Apple's range, but they're still made of flagship-quality materials, with enough power and performance to sustain years of use. iOS software updates, which are available to every model at the same time, generally provide five years of support, adding to the value of older models."
"110","However, be mindful of storage. The $599 iPhone 12 only comes with 64GB of space in its base model; if you want more capacity, be prepared for that price tag to go up. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini address that problem by bumping base storage to 128GB. The iPhone 14 lineup starts at 128GB, too."
"111","If you buy your iPhone through Apple, you may be able to save money by trading in your current phone. Ahead of the iPhone 15 launch, Apple raised trade-in values for some of its older phones. These days, you can get from $200 to $640 if you trade in an iPhone 11 or later. (The more recent your iPhone, the higher the trade-in value, and yes, switchers, Apple will accept Android devices, too.) "
"112","Note that if you buy your iPhone unlocked from Apple, you'll need to tack another $30 onto the base price of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. (The exception to this is the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.)"
"113","We track special offers from carriers and retailers to find the best iPhone deals by model:"
"114","When Apple releases new iPhones, it cuts the price on the models it keeps around. That's why you're paying less for the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 13 now that the the iPhone 15 series is here. Here's a look at the current iPhone models Apple may discontinue in the fall."
"115","All of the iPhones mentioned here can run iOS 16, which is available for download now. In fact, we're already up to iOS 16.5, which only introduced minor changes to the My Sports feature in the News app. iOS 16.6 is another minor release currently in beta, and we expect that update shortly."
"116","Even with iOS 16 out now, the attention is all on iOS 17, which Apple previewed at June's WWDC conference and released as a public beta in July. In our iOS 17 beta hands-on, we found that the new release isn't as loaded down with features as recent updates, but the ones that are there are pretty significant. We especially appreciate the new StandBy mode as well as the Check In feature that lets you tell people through the Message app that you've arrived safely. "
"117","iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro rumors have picked up steadily over the summer. So far, we've heard about potential features like a periscope camera for better zooming and USB-C replacing the phone's Lightning port. Talk of an iPhone 15 Ultra model has cooled — an Ultra phone may arrive in 2024 instead. That could mean more premium features for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. We should find out around September 12 — currently the rumored iPhone 15 release date."
"118","Another rumored device we're unlikely to see this year is the iPhone SE 4; the latest rumor about that budget phone suggests a new SE model won't arrive until 2024."
"119","Apple's chief rival Samsung has released new flagship phones. You can see how they compare to the current iPhones in our Samsung Galaxy S23 vs. iPhone 14 and Galaxy S23 Ultra vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max face-offs."
"120","As with any smartphone we test at Tom's Guide, we evaluate iPhones for days in real-world use cases. We also benchmark Apple's phones using a gamut of performance-measuring apps that allow us to compare iPhone performance to what Android devices are capable of. In addition to synthetic benchmarks, we also run real-world tests, including a video transcoding test in Adobe Premiere Rush that compares the iPhone's processing speed with other devices."
"121","In our lab, we use a light meter to ascertain display quality data, like brightness and color accuracy to help us evaluate the display of the best iPhones. Our proprietary battery test determines longevity on a charge by endlessly streaming webpages over an LTE network; we then recharge the iPhones to see how quickly they charge in 15-minute intervals."
"122","To compare cameras, we take any iPhone we review out and shoot photos in a variety of settings. We also bring along a comparable smartphone to see how the iPhone's photographic output measures up."
"123","We explore Apple's iOS improvements, test gaming performance and evaluate the phone's speakers — and each of these factors play a part in our final verdict."
