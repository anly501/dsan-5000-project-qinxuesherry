"- Hey, it's Justine and
today we are checking out",0.0,1.71
the brand new iPhone 15.,1.71,1.74
We've got the Plus in green,3.45,1.59
"and the regular iPhone 15 in pink,",5.04,2.493
"which obviously we know
that I'm excited about.",8.698,1.442
"Now, a lot of people are saying",10.14,1.17
"that this year's release was
a little bit underwhelming",11.31,2.67
and I actually think that this is probably,13.98,1.92
Apple's most impressive base model release,15.9,2.76
that they've had in a really long time.,18.66,1.89
And here's why.,20.55,1.21
(upbeat music),21.76,2.583
"First of all, I think the
actual physical design",39.03,2.04
of this new iPhone is really under hyped.,41.07,2.28
This new design with the rounded edges,43.35,2.13
"and the matte glass
back completely changes",45.48,2.58
the feel of the phone in your hand.,48.06,1.62
It's a big departure from the sharp edges,49.68,1.83
and glossy finish of the previous models,51.51,2.04
which has a huge impact overall,53.55,1.74
on the feel of this device.,55.29,1.47
It feels super premium,56.76,1.47
and with the new color infused glass,58.23,2.04
it looks really amazing too.,60.27,1.77
"I can't remember the last
time that a base model iPhone",62.04,2.317
felt and looked this good.,64.357,2.213
"And of course, one of the biggest",66.57,1.17
and most anticipated changes,67.74,1.65
"to the iPhone's design
is the move to USBC.",69.39,3.3
This has been such a long time coming,72.69,1.68
"and to finally have this
connectivity is really awesome.",74.37,2.85
"Being able to charge
multiple Apple devices",77.22,2.25
"with a single cable is gonna
make the whole experience",79.47,2.46
so much more streamlined.,81.93,1.26
Now there is a difference,83.19,1.531
"between the regular
iPhones and iPhone 15 Pros.",84.721,2.099
The iPhone 15 just has USB 2.0 speeds,86.82,2.91
and the Pros have USBC 3.0 speeds,89.73,2.56
"which is much faster for data transfer,",92.29,2.09
"which is something that
we'll definitely be using",94.38,2.04
"in those pro phones because
we can now shoot in ProRes log",96.42,3.21
"and some of those files can
tend to be on the larger side",99.63,2.4
"so we'll be able to
transfer them much quicker.",102.03,1.626
The iPhone 15 comes in two sizes,103.656,2.274
"with a 6.1 inch and 6.7 inch
super retina XDR display",105.93,4.41
with super durable ceramic shield glass.,110.34,2.49
"It comes in five colors,
pink, yellow, green,",112.83,3.42
"blue and black, and they all look so nice.",116.25,2.667
"The colors are really subtle,",118.917,1.503
"but also vibrant at the same time,",120.42,1.71
if that makes any sense.,122.13,1.23
"It's a little tough to describe,",123.36,1.32
but I'm such a big fan.,124.68,1.14
"And obviously the pink
finish is my favorite.",125.82,2.652
"(upbeat music)
(plane buzzing)",128.472,5.0
"Now, along with the changes
to the hardware design",140.73,1.92
the I iPhone 15 has been upgraded,142.65,1.44
"with many Pro features of
last year's Pro models.",144.09,3.18
It now has the 48 megapixel main camera,147.27,2.52
that we got with the iPhone 14 Pro.,149.79,1.92
It shoots super high resolution photos,151.71,2.25
and with that resolution,153.96,1.26
"you get three different
optical quality zoom levels,",155.22,2.97
"an ultra wide lens, regular lens,",158.19,1.98
and a 2x lens that all produce photos,160.17,2.25
with incredible detail.,162.42,1.29
And all of these cameras are made better,163.71,1.8
"by sensor shift optical
image stabilization.",165.51,2.311
(upbeat music),167.821,2.583
The smooth zoom is also really nice.,188.1,1.8
"This allows you to get some
super detailed zoom shots",189.9,3.75
"and you can zoom in very
smoothly optically and digitally",193.65,2.569
switching between the lenses.,196.219,1.871
"Something else that is
a really cool option",198.09,1.68
is they now have a HEIF Max photo option.,199.77,2.25
"So when you have this turned on,",202.02,1.32
"you have the ability to take
the full 48 megapixel images,",203.34,3.21
but it's not in that huge raw file size,206.55,2.28
that you'll see on the pros.,208.83,1.29
"With this, for most people,",210.12,1.26
"they're gonna be super
happy with the output.",211.38,1.999
(upbeat music),213.379,2.583
"Night mode, and portraits
have new upgrades as well.",232.23,2.49
So night mode will activate automatically,234.72,1.74
"in dark scenes and with
a new high res camera,",236.46,2.55
"colors and detail come
through so much better.",239.01,2.67
"Now this is true for
portrait mode as well,",241.68,2.13
"and now after you've taken a portrait,",243.81,1.62
"you can tap into the
image to change the focus",245.43,2.19
from one subject to another.,247.62,1.5
This is pretty awesome.,249.12,1.17
It's ice cream time.,250.29,1.35
This is the first video,251.64,0.99
that I'm filming on the new iPhone 15.,252.63,2.37
"And of course we have to get
a little mint chocolate chip",255.0,2.19
"to match the new, well I'm
gonna call it mint green foam.",257.19,3.57
"If they don't have mitt
chip, I'm gonna be so upset.",260.76,3.543
(beeping),270.469,0.833
"We interrupt this iPhone
15 review to bring you",271.302,1.998
"a word from our sponsor, Rhino Shield.",273.3,2.13
They sent me so many cases to check out,275.43,2.46
for my new iPhone 15,277.89,1.2
and a discount code for all of you guys,279.09,1.77
"if you want to check out
some of their new cases",280.86,1.74
"and some of their older
cases for previous gens",282.6,1.854
"you can use ijustine for
10% off at checkouts.",284.454,2.641
"They also have cases for
Apple watches, AirPods,",287.095,3.365
and again if you aren't upgrading,290.46,1.29
"and getting a new phone this year,",291.75,1.26
"you can upgrade with cases
from some previous generations.",293.01,2.79
"I mean, there are so many to choose from.",295.8,2.22
"They're MagSafe compatible
have an 11 foot drop protection",298.02,3.06
with their shock spread technology,301.08,1.53
and 360 degrees of protection.,302.61,2.01
It's also cool that their clear cases,304.62,1.44
come with a five year warranty,306.06,1.38
against yellowing or discoloration.,307.44,1.71
"They have a lot of new
colors for the iPhone 15",309.15,1.978
"and even an improved
grip on solid suitcases.",311.128,2.912
I also love these three D impact screens.,314.04,1.53
They have a transparency one,315.57,1.38
"and a privacy shield
to protect your screen",316.95,1.722
"from sneaky eyes trying to
see what's on your screen.",318.672,3.918
"The Mod NX are really fun,",322.59,1.68
"because they allow you to
accessorize your clear cases",324.27,2.52
with different bumpers.,326.79,1.11
They also sent this aqua stand,327.9,1.17
that I'm so excited to test out.,329.07,1.47
"It's a water bottle,",330.54,0.833
but it also has a Magsafe flip on the top.,331.373,2.497
So if you're somebody who likes,333.87,0.9
"to film your workouts in the gym,",334.77,1.26
"this is definitely the
water bottle for you.",336.03,2.13
"Flip it up, put the phone
on it, and that's it.",338.16,2.88
"Again, for 10% off, you can
use ijustine at checkout.",341.04,2.82
I'll put a link in the description.,343.86,1.29
Thank you again to Rhino Shield,345.15,1.23
for sponsoring a portion of this video.,346.38,1.819
"(beeping)
(upbeat music)",348.199,4.75
- Can I get a mint chip in waffle cone?,358.277,1.783
"- Mint chip waffle cone?
- Yes, thank you.",360.06,2.093
Look at this.,364.77,0.833
"Oh my goodness, my mint phone",365.603,1.597
and mint chocolate chip ice cream.,367.2,1.32
I'm so excited.,368.52,1.752
"The cone was basically
staged for the the shot.",370.272,1.236
I gotta eat it like this.,371.508,1.815
It's still good.,376.293,0.98
I'm so happy.,377.273,1.083
The iPhone 15 also now has Dynamic Island.,380.221,2.339
Last year's base models,382.56,1.29
were still rocking the old school notch,383.85,1.89
"at the top of the screen,",385.74,2.049
but now all of the models,387.789,0.833
get to enjoy this added functionality.,388.622,1.318
"Now if you're not
already familiar with it,",389.94,1.5
Dynamic Island takes what used to be,391.44,1.77
"just black cutout for the
front camera and sensors",393.21,2.46
and it uses that space to display alerts,395.67,2.01
and live activities.,397.68,1.02
"So when you get a call or you order food,",398.7,2.1
"or things like that,",400.8,0.9
you'll get these cool dynamic animations.,401.7,1.934
Something else I'm excited about,403.634,1.606
"is this new integration with
iOS 17 called name drop.",405.24,4.02
"So you can bring your phones
close together, just like this,",409.26,2.88
"and you can instantly share
your contact information.",412.14,2.52
"Now I use Airdrop all the time,",414.66,1.44
so I love that in iOS 17,416.1,1.68
"Airdrop is now taking
advantage of wifi and cellular.",417.78,3.72
So if I'm airdropping a file,421.5,1.329
"and I happen to not be
close to that phone anymore,",422.829,3.741
"as I venture off into the world,",426.57,1.83
"I can continue sending
this through cellular",428.4,2.49
or sending it through the internet,430.89,1.29
when I get home to wifi.,432.18,1.35
"Something else that's really
fun is FaceTime voicemail.",433.53,2.581
"So if I don't answer a call,",436.111,2.579
like this call from Tyler that's coming in,438.69,2.43
"and I decide to ignore it,",441.12,2.067
"you can actually leave
me a voicemail video.",443.187,3.062
"- Hey Justine, I'm in
your studio right now.",446.249,2.517
I'm just wondering why you're not here.,448.766,3.217
'cause we have to shoot.,451.983,1.497
So just let me know.,453.48,1.753
"Call me back, thanks, bye.",455.233,0.833
"- I also really like the
live voicemail transcription.",456.066,2.934
I don't like talking on the phone really,459.0,1.95
"so I get a lot of voicemails,",460.95,2.22
"because everyone knows that
I don't answer my phone.",463.17,2.07
"So this is cool because I
can watch the voicemail text",465.24,2.284
transcribe itself live and decide,467.524,2.244
"if it's actually important
and I have to answer.",469.768,2.852
"Hello, are you okay?",472.62,1.49
"- [Tyler] Oh yeah, I'm good.",474.11,1.78
"I'm just recording this fake
voicemail for the video.",475.89,2.7
"- Okay, bye.",478.59,0.833
"Now, powering all of this is of course",480.328,2.298
Apple's A16 bionic chip,482.626,2.324
and this is the same chip that we had,484.95,1.47
in last year's pro models.,486.42,1.56
"So the iPhone 15 is getting
a big performance upgrade.",487.98,2.61
This is a six core CPU,490.59,2.16
"with two performance cores
and four efficiency cores",492.75,2.01
which is what creates all that power,494.76,1.8
"and performance while
keeping great battery life.",496.56,2.1
It also has a five core GPU,498.66,1.74
and 16 core neural engine power,500.4,1.95
and computational photography,502.35,1.41
"and graphics intensive
activities like gaming.",503.76,2.61
So that's it for the iPhone 15s.,506.37,1.65
"This is a really fun review to do,",508.02,1.44
because I'm really impressed,509.46,1.32
"with how incredible these
phones are this year.",510.78,2.55
"And like I said, the design change",513.33,1.86
"and everything about
them is pretty exciting.",515.19,2.61
So if you're looking to upgrade,517.8,1.5
from an older phone and you don't think,519.3,1.62
"that the Pro is for you,",520.92,0.99
"I'm confident that the
base model iPhone 15s",521.91,2.55
"are something that you're
gonna be super hyped about.",524.46,1.95
If you wanna check out more videos,526.41,1.11
they are here at the end.,527.52,1.926
"And of course, subscribe.",529.446,0.833
"Hit the bell to be notified
when I post new videos",530.279,1.681
and leave me some comments below.,531.96,1.38
"I can't wait to hear from you, bye.",533.34,1.75
"- Here it is, the brand new
iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.",0.09,4.749
(bright music),4.839,3.261
While everyone likes to joke,8.1,1.29
"that it's the same phone as
last year, you'd be wrong.",9.39,3.09
"Especially for photographers
and videographers,",12.48,2.4
it is so hard to even call this a phone.,14.88,2.13
"With the introduction of
USB-C for fast data transfer,",17.01,2.97
"the new 5X Telephoto and ProRes Log,",19.98,2.7
"it just so happens that my
camera can make phone calls.",22.68,3.128
(upbeat music),25.808,2.667
"The camera of course is where
the new iPhone 15 Pro shines",30.57,2.67
"but also this new
titanium finish that comes",33.24,3.06
"in natural, black,
white, and blue titanium.",36.3,3.03
I've got the new natural color right here,39.33,2.4
"and also the blue and
they are just so stunning",41.73,2.88
"like the way that they reflect
the light, so beautiful.",44.61,2.97
"The thing that is also
really surprising is",47.58,1.68
"how light they are compared
to the previous version.",49.26,2.49
"It's only a slight weight difference,",51.75,1.98
"but with these new rounded edges,",53.73,1.74
it has an all new feel to it.,55.47,1.47
"Now if you have an Apple Watch Ultra,",56.94,1.5
"this new natural titanium
is a perfect match.",58.44,3.18
"Another huge design change
is it now finally has USB-C.",61.62,4.14
The Pro models will support up,65.76,1.41
to USB-C speeds that are 20 times faster,67.17,3.09
than the regular iPhone 15.,70.26,1.53
This is because,71.79,0.833
"of the all new A17 Pro chip
for enhanced performance.",72.623,2.887
"So they've now made an action
button on the iPhone 15 Pros.",75.51,3.45
"This used to be where
the silent switch was",78.96,2.22
"but now you can actually
customize this button",81.18,1.77
to do basically whatever you want.,82.95,1.74
"You can still have it silence
your iPhone if you choose to,",84.69,2.82
"but you can select from focus modes,",87.51,1.92
"camera options, flashlights,
voice memo, magnifier.",89.43,3.84
"You can create custom
shortcuts, accessibility,",93.27,2.64
"or you can have it do nothing,
which is kind of pointless.",95.91,2.31
"I don't know why you
would even select that.",98.22,1.65
I have mine set up to access the camera,99.87,1.86
"since that's pretty much
what I use my phone for.",101.73,2.16
"You can even use the action
button as a shutter button.",103.89,1.95
The display has slightly thinner borders.,105.84,2.22
Dynamic Island is back and ProMotion,108.06,2.49
"on the Pros give you a
super smooth animation.",110.55,2.61
You can choose from the 6.1 inch,113.16,1.77
"or the 6.7 inch sizes,",114.93,1.59
but the Max version is the only camera,116.52,2.16
that has the 5X zoom.,118.68,1.41
"Now speaking of 5X zoom,",120.09,1.95
"this new tech in the
Telephoto is called Tetraprism",122.04,2.97
"and this uses a series
of mirrors to reflect",125.01,2.31
"and magnify to keep the
camera lens much smaller.",127.32,2.94
"That's one of the things
that we always joke about.",130.26,1.44
"Each year, the camera bumps
get larger and larger.",131.7,2.04
"So using this Tetraprism, this allows",133.74,1.83
"for you to keep the
camera bumps much smaller",135.57,2.04
"and they don't have to
be increased in size",137.61,1.89
"but yet we still get
that 5X magnification.",139.5,2.544
(upbeat music),142.044,2.556
"So here on Catalina,
there's this old casino",144.6,2.31
and it's now turned into a museum,146.91,1.62
"and a dive shop and
we're up here on the hill",148.53,1.86
and I'm gonna show you guys a little demo,150.39,1.53
"of the zoom that we have
on the new 15 Pro Max only.",151.92,3.93
"It'll go up to 5X, but the
main camera now also can act",155.85,2.576
"as three lenses, a 24, a
28, and a 35 millimeter.",158.426,4.984
"So when you click through on the 1X,",163.41,2.16
"you'll be able to see those
change just like this.",165.57,2.31
My favorite demo though is going,167.88,0.833
"from the wide angle all
the way into the 5X.",168.713,3.217
This really shows you the perspective,171.93,1.71
that you're able to get.,173.64,0.96
"This is equivalent to 120
millimeter focal length,",174.6,2.91
pretty far out dude.,177.51,1.413
I took the new phones,180.81,0.833
to Catalina to test them out diving.,181.643,2.498
(soft music),184.141,2.417
(upbeat music),196.044,2.667
They are water and dust resistant,200.07,1.92
up to six meters for 30 minutes.,201.99,2.25
But I use this new Oceanic+ housing,204.24,2.46
"which will let you turn your
phone into a dive computer",206.7,2.55
"and also capture videos
and photos up to 196 feet.",209.25,3.479
Now I have a full review,212.729,1.201
"on this housing in another
video, but it is so incredible.",213.93,3.15
"Now most of this video footage
that you're seeing here",217.08,2.13
I shot in 4K 60 because this lets me slow,219.21,2.85
"down the footage and post
if I see a fast fishy",222.06,2.7
"or if I'm floating around
too fast in a current.",224.76,2.46
"Oceanic+ is the same app
that was launched last year",227.22,2.73
"with the Apple Watch Ultra to
let you turn your Apple Watch",229.95,2.37
into a dive computer.,232.32,1.05
"So it is so cool that you can
now do this with your iPhone.",233.37,2.978
(soft music),236.348,2.417
I love testing out taking photos,243.54,1.073
and videos all around Catalina.,244.613,1.987
"My favorite thing we shot
though was this Wes Anderson's",246.6,2.73
"To Health TikTok meme
video using the ProRes Log.",249.33,2.82
And I'm so happy with how it turned out.,252.15,2.16

Shooting in Log is really cool,303.63,1.02
"because it gives you so much
more flexibility in editing",304.65,2.01
"with color and it also
can save some highlights",306.66,2.13
if it's a super bright day.,308.79,1.38
"So let's test them out
and see what we got.",310.17,2.789
(upbeat music),312.959,2.667
I also didn't realize that you can shoot,321.33,2.16
in ProRes on the front facing camera.,323.49,1.95
"So right now, shooting
ProRes, front facing camera.",325.44,3.18
"Now the thing with ProRes
though is it is going",328.62,2.73
"to increase your file sizes, which is one",331.35,1.8
"of the reasons why this feature
is specifically on the Pros.",333.15,3.15
"Now if I want to shoot in 4K 60,",336.3,2.22
"this is where a little
notification pops up",338.52,2.1
"and it says ProRes not supported,",340.62,1.89
"but it will be supported when
recording to external storage.",342.51,3.12
Now I'm gonna try recording externally,345.63,2.04
"to this little OWC drive,
this is one terabyte.",347.67,2.43
So we're gonna switch this,350.1,0.87
"into the ProRes Log and
to 60 frames a second,",350.97,2.82
"plug it in, and it's time to record.",353.79,2.308
(upbeat music),356.098,2.667
I was also super impressed,364.38,1.35
with how well it shot videos at night.,365.73,1.92
Here's the demo of a shot that was shot,367.65,1.74
in Log and here is one that's just regular,369.39,2.52
"and you can kind of
see here in the lights,",371.91,1.5
how it's saved a little more detail,373.41,1.68
and it's less blown out around the lights.,375.09,1.86
"Night Mode also got a
little boost as well.",376.95,2.37
"So here's a few photos that
I took handheld on the 15.",379.32,3.0
"You can see all of the detail here,",382.32,1.8
"especially in the 5X zoom,
it's pretty impressive.",384.12,2.76
"This is a difficult shot 'cause
there's like a lot of light.",386.88,2.04

that Apple has ever made.",413.58,2.58
"I like to kind of test
them out in comparison",416.16,1.403
to the previous version.,417.563,1.507
Let's see if we can tell the difference.,419.07,1.718
(upbeat music),420.788,2.583

"This is how you properly
do an iPhone review.",441.27,3.014
(upbeat music),444.284,2.667
There's a few new pro options now,451.23,1.86
"that you can quickly access
here in the top menu.",453.09,2.25
"Now you do need to first turn
these on in the settings.",455.34,2.79
"Now when you're in the
camera, you can press to hold",458.13,2.31
"and quickly switch between
the options as needed.",460.44,2.16
"I shot most of my photos just
in normal mode and in RAW max.",462.6,3.57
"The HEIF mode will give you
a higher resolution image",466.17,2.55
"at a much smaller file size,",468.72,1.65
"But since I have the one terabyte phone,",470.37,1.65
I just shot in the Pro Max resolution,472.02,1.77
"for most of my photos when I
wasn't shooting in the normal.",473.79,2.58
"It's golf cart time,
this is my favorite part",476.37,2.13

(upbeat music),481.372,2.583
Now Action Mode isn't something new,490.68,1.86
but it's still so impressive.,492.54,1.47
"You can also see in this
demo here that we're",494.01,1.59
on a super bouncy golf cart and it's able,495.6,2.01
"to really stabilize that
footage so much better",497.61,2.291
and it made it super smooth.,499.901,1.939
"These were also shot in Log,",501.84,1.53
"so here's what it looks
like before the color",503.37,2.64
and here's what it looks like after.,506.01,1.74
"I'm not gonna lie, I don't
really shoot that much",507.75,2.07
"in Cinematic Mode normally, but when I do,",509.82,2.588
"I'm always so impressed
with how great it looks.",512.408,2.752
"So now Cinematic Mode
supports digital zoom",515.16,2.34
"from 1X to 3X, so you can tap one or two",517.5,3.48
and then you can use the scroll wheel,520.98,1.26
to go all the way up to three.,522.24,1.35
"Now in regular video
you can do this as well",523.59,2.07
but all the way up to 15.,525.66,1.38
"Something else I noticed
is how smooth the zoom is.",527.04,3.12
"So when you're using the scroll wheel,",530.16,1.62
"you can really fine tune
your zoom and get as close",531.78,2.76
"or as far away from your
subject as you like.",534.54,2.851
(warm music),537.391,2.699
"I love being able to go in

as you tap on something",542.52,2.002
"on the screen as you're playing the video,",544.522,2.258
"it'll change the focus
from whichever point",546.78,2.237
of interest that you want it to focus on.,549.017,2.473
"So as you'll see here, I've tapped",551.49,0.849
on my face and then I've tapped back here,552.339,2.571
"on the background and now
it's focusing not on me,",554.91,3.3
it's focusing more in the background.,558.21,1.8
"And as you continue
through on this timeline,",560.01,1.603
"this gives you the ability to
reshoot what you already shot.",561.613,3.527
"It's also great because if
you do bring a cinematic clip",565.14,1.8
"into Final Cut, you can do the same action",566.94,2.25
and change the focal point there as well.,569.19,1.894
(warm music),571.084,2.5
"Obviously for me, testing out photos",574.74,1.8
"and video is my favorite thing, but a few",576.54,2.03
"of the other updates is
the new wireless tech.",578.57,2.71
"With the new second gen
Ultra Wideband chip,",581.28,2.13
"this enables precision
finding for friends.",583.41,2.13
"Now, this is of course only if
your friend wants to be found",585.54,2.64
"but when you turn this on,
it'll give you precise turn",588.18,2.7
"by turn directions of
getting to your friend,",590.88,2.04
"much like when you're
trying to find your AirPods.",592.92,2.13
"So I love gaming and they
are really turning this phone",595.05,2.97
into a console level gaming device.,598.02,2.43
"With the new A7 pro chip,",600.45,1.62
"this is giving performance
improvements for games",602.07,2.28
"like mesh shading and hardware
accelerated ray tracing.",604.35,3.18
"I also really like that
I can charge my AirPods",607.53,1.92
"or Apple Watch using the charge
port and since it's USB-C,",609.45,2.95
this is a great time,612.4,1.07
"to pick yourself up a nice
pink iJustine USB-C cable",613.47,3.06
"to go with it, pinkijustinecables.com,
shameless plug.",616.53,3.21
Roadside assistance has also been added,619.74,2.31
"to the satellite emergency
offering using AAA,",622.05,2.61

AAA, so hyped about that.",624.66,2.28
"This is pretty great if you
get a flat tire or you break",626.94,2.37
"down and you need help,
I've definitely been there.",629.31,2.97
"So it is nice to know that
you can use the satellite",632.28,2.01
"for more than just a
super emergency situation.",634.29,2.37
"So all in all, I have been
loving the new phone and",636.66,2.28
"of course if you do already
have an iPhone 14 Pro device,",638.94,2.308
"this isn't gonna be like some huge,",641.248,1.952
"massive overhaul physically,",643.2,1.62
"but if you are super into video,",644.82,1.77
"the new zoom and the ability
to shoot in Log is so awesome.",646.59,3.78
"I love the new titanium
finish and how light it is.",650.37,2.73
It just feels so nice in your hand.,653.1,1.8
"It's fast, with all of
the added iOS 17 features,",654.9,2.85
"it definitely does feel
like a really great upgrade.",657.75,2.49
I have a bunch of other Apple videos here,660.24,1.44
if you wanna check them out after this.,661.68,1.59
"Thank you guys for
watching and let me know",663.27,1.44
"what your favorite color
iPhone is this season.",664.71,2.35
"- All right, so this is an iPhone 15",0.45,2.61
"and a 15 Plus and a 15
Pro and a 15 Pro Max,",3.06,4.35
every new phone in the lineup.,7.41,1.35
"New colors, new materials, new ports.",8.76,2.97
"There's some good stuff to unbox here,",11.73,1.44
so let's do it.,13.17,1.62
So starting with iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.,14.79,2.58
"This iPhone 15 here is the
new blue color, and it is,",17.37,5.0
I'm just gonna go ahead,22.62,0.833
and rename this color to barely blue.,23.453,2.227
"I think that's an appropriate name,",25.68,1.14
"because it really is barely
giving hints of blue.",26.82,3.45
"You can really see it
on the side rails too.",30.27,2.16
"But yeah, really subtle colors
across the board this year.",32.43,3.66
"Anyway, the other things in
the box are the paperwork,",36.09,2.31
"the single white Apple sticker,",38.4,2.16
and there is no SIM card ejector tool here,40.56,2.04
"since they're all eSIM,
at least in the US now.",42.6,2.31
"But most importantly, the
new cable in the iPhone box",44.91,2.4
for all new iPhones,47.31,1.83
"is a single, white, braided
USB-C to USB-C cable.",49.14,4.53
I think this is the first time the iPhone,53.67,1.2
"is shipping with a braided
nice cable like this.",54.87,2.55
So hopefully it'll be a higher quality,57.42,1.62
and more durable than old cables,59.04,1.92
we've been getting for years.,60.96,1.32
"So, cool, USB-C cable, USB-C phone.",62.28,2.91
"Now, if we take a look at the Plus,",65.19,1.74
"same idea, bigger box,",66.93,1.53
but this new incredibly pale yellow.,68.46,3.0
"I mean, again, in perfect
lighting at the Apple event",71.46,3.0
"I think it looked a
little bit more colorful,",74.46,1.47
but it just looks extremely pale out here.,75.93,2.52
"And then we've got the Pro boxes
for the Pro phones as well.",78.45,3.27
"Still white boxes, but dark wallpapers.",81.72,2.49
"So the iPhone 15 Pro I have
here is the new dark blue color.",84.21,4.26
"I almost want to call this
one barely blue again,",88.47,2.49
but this time it's darker,90.96,1.35
and kind of borders on gray,92.31,1.44
"when the light hits it
from certain angles.",93.75,1.56
Very safe.,95.31,0.833
"Same stuff in the box after that though,",96.143,1.507
"the paperwork, the white Apple sticker,",97.65,1.98
and the new braided USB-C cable.,99.63,2.31
And then our iPhone 15 Pro Max here,101.94,2.19
is the new Natural Titanium color.,104.13,2.7
"And I gotta say, guys,",106.83,2.07
I think this is gonna be the one to get.,108.9,2.28
It's the best color in person in the hand.,111.18,2.7
"I'll talk more about why in a minute,",113.88,1.26
but there you have it.,115.14,1.5
The slightly new unboxing experience,116.64,2.85
on iPhone 15s and 15 Pros.,119.49,2.4
"So by the time you see this,",121.89,1.2
"I've been testing these
phones for about six days now.",123.09,4.02
"Not quite enough time for
a review by my standards,",127.11,2.34
but still plenty of time,129.45,0.93
"to give you some interesting thoughts,",130.38,1.53
"some things that I've picked
up on, and some quirks.",131.91,2.52
"So first of all, these pale colors.",134.43,2.28
I don't really know how else to say it.,136.71,1.11
"Like, this might be totally fine with you.",137.82,1.83
I always get told,139.65,0.833
"everyone's gonna put
a case on their phone,",140.483,1.417
which they probably are.,141.9,1.26
"But hey, Apple did spend
a ton of time and money",143.16,1.95
"making this new softer touch
satin finish on the back,",145.11,3.39
"and some of us,",148.5,0.96
"some of us will carry our
phones around with no case,",149.46,3.09
so it's worth mentioning.,152.55,1.8
For the Pro phones,154.35,0.99
"there's actually an extra
layer of interesting though,",155.34,2.22
"because they've switched
that rail material,",157.56,2.13
"the part that you actually
touch on the outside,",159.69,1.83
"from shiny stainless
steel to brushed titanium.",161.52,3.93
"We've all heard about
how much lighter it is,",165.45,2.01
"and it's something like 10% lighter,",167.46,1.77
"which is enough for me
to notice and enjoy.",169.23,1.86
"But the other thing is I
thought the brushed finish",171.09,2.25
"would sort of eliminate
fingerprints on the sides.",173.34,2.28
Absolutely not.,175.62,0.833
I was wrong about that.,176.453,1.177
"I mean, it's less,",177.63,0.833
"it's not as bad as stainless steel,",178.463,1.357
but especially on these darker colors,179.82,1.62
"like the black or this blue,",181.44,2.34
you can totally see fingerprints,183.78,1.65
and sort of where your hand oils,185.43,2.13
are marking up the sides of the phone.,187.56,2.22
"And then on top of that,",189.78,1.08
"this is not anodized
like aluminum might be.",190.86,2.34
"This is the new PVD coating
they talked about on stage.",193.2,2.67
"And it's only been a week here for me,",195.87,1.77
and so I don't know exactly how well,197.64,1.62
"this will hold up over time,",199.26,1.32
but what I do know is if you get a scratch,200.58,2.64
"deep enough into this coating,",203.22,2.49
"it's gotta be the Natural
Titanium color underneath,",205.71,2.67
which is very light.,208.38,1.47
"And so that might look rough,",209.85,1.05
if you drop this phone with no case,210.9,1.92
"and get like a big gash
on your dark colored phone",212.82,2.91
and have light marks all over it.,215.73,1.56
"All of that to say,",217.29,1.14
"I do really think that this
Natural Titanium or the light",218.43,3.93
"is gonna be the better color
to get on the Pros this year.",222.36,3.45
"Okay, some things I've
noticed in my first week.",225.81,2.01
"So first of all, on the Pro,",227.82,1.53
"the bezels are technically
a little bit thinner,",229.35,2.01
"which makes the body a little smaller,",231.36,2.04
"but you really don't notice
that much after a few minutes.",233.4,2.37
What you do notice more actually visually,235.77,2.1
is the slightly softer curves,237.87,1.77
"all the way around these phones,",239.64,1.2
"seriously, on the 15 and 15 Pro.",240.84,1.86
"Because on the 14 it was so square,",242.7,2.49
"like it just went straight to
the edge with a flat display",245.19,2.91
"and then it dropped right
into the rail at 90 degrees.",248.1,2.58
"On these new phones,",250.68,0.99
the edge of the front glass,251.67,1.47
"actually has a little bit
of curve at the very edges,",253.14,2.55
so it's a softer curve into the rail.,255.69,2.13
Then the rail itself has softer curves,257.82,2.19
"than the totally sharp
corners from last year.",260.01,2.52
So I think it's a nice hybrid,262.53,1.2
of making it just more comfortable,263.73,1.71
"in the hand with these curves,",265.44,1.08
but still keeping the generally boxy look.,266.52,2.25
"Now, with USB-C on these phones,",268.77,1.71
"we already learned that you
can just plug in a cable",270.48,2.46
"to charge an accessory, right?",272.94,1.62
"So it's no reverse wireless charging,",274.56,2.25
but you can at least plug in a USB-C cable,276.81,2.1
straight to AirPods,278.91,1.98
"or an Apple Watch MagSafe
charger, whatever,",280.89,1.98
"and it will charge from
your phone's battery.",282.87,2.1
"So that's already pretty interesting,",284.97,1.68
but I decided it's worth learning,286.65,1.65
all the rules and behaviors,288.3,1.59
of plugging things into the iPhone 15s.,289.89,2.73
So here they are.,292.62,0.833
"So if you plug in any
older Lightning iPhone",293.453,3.547
"into a USB-C iPhone,",297.0,1.47
"regardless of the charge state,",298.47,1.56
the USB-C iPhone will always give battery,300.03,2.97
"to the Lightning iPhone,",303.0,1.38
every single time no matter what.,304.38,2.4
"Now, if you plug in another USB-C iPhone",306.78,2.73
"into your USB-C iPhone,",309.51,2.04
"it actually does a handshake
where they talk to each other,",311.55,2.34
"figure out which one
has the lower battery,",313.89,2.37
"and then the one with the
higher state of charge goes,",316.26,2.257
"""All right, I'm a battery bank,",318.517,1.493
and I will start charging the one,320.01,1.59
"with the lower stated of charge,""",321.6,1.44
all the way till you unplug it.,323.04,1.29
So I thought that was pretty interesting,324.33,1.23
and it works pretty well.,325.56,1.2
"Then I decided to try a
couple of Android phones",326.76,3.18
and see if the same handshake happened.,329.94,2.19
Basically what we found,332.13,1.23
"is if you plug into your
friend's Android phone",333.36,2.64
who has more battery than you,336.0,1.56
"and that phone has USB PD,",337.56,2.28
it will actually act like a battery bank.,339.84,2.04
"But if the phone doesn't have USB PD,",341.88,2.1
"which is a bunch actually right now,",343.98,2.37
it's pretty inconsistent,346.35,1.05
and you could end up charging it,347.4,1.23
or it could end up charging you.,348.63,1.74
Literally unplug and try it again.,350.37,1.95
"But if it has USB Power Delivery,",352.32,2.16
"it will actually do the same
handshake that the iPhones do.",354.48,2.43
"It's only 4 1/2 watts out,",356.91,1.62
so it's not huge.,358.53,0.9
It's not gonna fast charge or anything.,359.43,1.68
"But, you know, it is
ideal for accessories.",361.11,2.22
You can literally use the cable in the box,363.33,1.8
to charge up the new AirPods,365.13,2.19
or whatever else you wanna try.,367.32,1.56
"But yeah, you can rescue
another smartphone in a pinch.",368.88,3.21
So then the new Action button on the Pros.,372.09,3.24
I was very curious about this.,375.33,1.2
"I was not sure if it would
have some restrictions",376.53,2.37
"or if there's some things
that it wouldn't let you do,",378.9,2.49
"and it turns out I haven't
been able to find any so far.",381.39,3.75
"It seems like it basically
lets you do anything you want,",385.14,2.28
and I'm very happy about that.,387.42,1.38
"I mean, this was a feature",388.8,1.11
of a lot of Android phones in the past.,389.91,1.98
"There were some LG phones that did this,",391.89,1.71
"some Sony phones, I wanna
say some ASUS phones.",393.6,2.79
"I'm hoping it starts to make
a bit of a comeback here,",396.39,1.92
because on this new iPhone it is great.,398.31,2.91
So you jump into the settings,401.22,1.35
"and go to Action button,",402.57,1.74
and it loads up this whole crazy UI,404.31,2.25
"that's just nothing like any
of the other settings pages",406.56,2.94
"on the iPhone,",409.5,0.833
"like they just stapled
this in here, but okay.",410.333,3.067
"And as I showed you in
the impressions video,",413.4,1.71
you can do any number,415.11,0.84
of pre-programmed things with this button.,415.95,2.01
"By default, it is still the
mute switch that it replaces,",417.96,3.06
"and it has those two
different haptic patterns.",421.02,2.04
"So when you mute it in your pocket,",423.06,1.5
you know exactly what you're doing,424.56,1.17
"without even checking
you did it correctly.",425.73,1.89
"But honestly, I don't know.",427.62,1.17
"I leave my phone on mute
most of the time anyway.",428.79,2.16
So you can also have it open up the camera,430.95,2.22
in any of the camera modes.,433.17,1.32
"But then again, the camera shortcut",434.49,1.74
"is, like, right on your
lock screen already,",436.23,1.65
and I'm pretty used to that.,437.88,1.59
Same thing with the flashlight.,439.47,1.11
"You could do that,",440.58,0.833
"but it's also already on
everyone's lock screen.",441.413,2.917
I like the voice memo trigger.,444.33,1.2
It's actually pretty convenient,445.53,0.96
because it immediately starts recording,446.49,2.04
when you press and hold the button.,448.53,1.26
"But my favorite by a mile is
the Siri Shortcuts function",449.79,4.41
"because it basically lets
you do anything else.",454.2,2.46
"You can stack up a bunch
of different functions",456.66,2.49
"that are, like, location dependent,",459.15,1.83
or you can have it call a certain contact,460.98,2.67
"or do certain things,",463.65,1.2
or if you just wanna literally open,464.85,1.74
any app on your phone with zero lag.,466.59,2.1
"So it could be your to-do
list app or your calendar app",468.69,2.52
"or just open YouTube with
any one button press.",471.21,3.03
Whatever you want.,474.24,0.9
"For me, I'm gonna map my Action button",475.14,3.27
"on my brand new iPhone
to the Google Assistant,",478.41,3.81
"the best assistant
available on the iPhone.",482.22,2.55
"Also, Apple, if you're listening,",484.77,2.1
I also wish you could map a double press,486.87,2.82
or a triple press of the Action button,489.69,2.64
to a new specific function.,492.33,2.163
Just think about it.,495.48,1.14
"Also, I was kind of curious",496.62,0.84
"how cases would handle
this new Action button.",497.46,2.04
So I asked channel sponsor dbrand,499.5,1.35
"to send over their new Ghost case,",500.85,1.68
and I have it here.,502.53,0.833
"Personally, pretty solid.",503.363,1.537
"I think this matte black
skeleton design looks sick.",504.9,2.37
"And yes, I can confirm
that even with the case,",507.27,2.4
"the Action button still
feels nice and clicky.",509.67,2.25
"Now, I might be thinking,",511.92,0.833
"all right, what's so special
about this clear case?",512.753,2.617
I've seen a million clear cases.,515.37,1.44
"And between the skeleton and MagSafe,",516.81,1.56
"there's a bunch of other stuff,",518.37,0.96
but my favorite personally,519.33,1.56
"is if you've ever owned
a clear case before,",520.89,1.92
you probably know that after a while,522.81,1.41
"it kind of ends up looking like this,",524.22,2.55
which is disgusting and yellow.,526.77,1.35
But dbrand has promised me,528.12,1.2
"that they've specifically
engineered the Ghost case",529.32,2.64
"to be impossible to yellow,",531.96,2.163
and they use those words themselves.,535.08,1.47
So they actually give you,536.55,1.59
"a lifetime case replacement
guarantee if it every yellows.",538.14,3.66
So that's either a real promise,541.8,3.12
"or free cases for life, the way I see it.",544.92,2.67
"Either way, if you're interested,",547.59,0.96
I'll leave a link below the like button,548.55,0.99
if you wanna check it out.,549.54,0.93
That's the dbrand Ghost case.,550.47,1.17
"Now, I've also been taking
some pictures and videos",551.64,1.77
with these new cameras,553.41,0.87
to get a sense of how they perform.,554.28,1.56
"I will be taking many, many more,",555.84,1.41
"posting them on on Twitter
if you wanna follow me there.",557.25,2.61
Instagram as well.,559.86,1.26
I also fully plan on shooting,561.12,1.38
"the next Auto Focus car
channel video with this phone,",562.5,2.82
"so you already know you
can go subscribe over there",565.32,2.01
"to see how the video looks,",567.33,1.38
to hear how the microphones sound.,568.71,1.5
"One thing that they did mention
in the keynote specifically",570.21,2.31
"was there was a new
coating over the lenses",572.52,2.37
"that I immediately thought,",574.89,1.77
"oh, does this fix the horrible
nighttime flare issues",576.66,3.75
with the iPhone's video?,580.41,1.77
"First thing I did was go to a dark room,",582.18,1.8
"bring it out at night,
shoot with some lights.",583.98,2.16
"No, it didn't fix it, unfortunately.",586.14,2.61
I'm sure the coating,588.75,0.833
"does some other great
stuff during the daytime,",589.583,1.447
"but there's still flare issues, sadly.",591.03,2.37
"But also, lastly,",593.4,0.833
"I wanna clarify the new camera
behavior on the Pro phones.",594.233,3.187
"In the impressions video,",597.42,0.99
"I was a little down on the whole, like,",598.41,1.435
"1x versus 1.2x versus 1.5x thing,",599.845,3.545
"because I thought it was
literally just a digital crop,",603.39,2.4
which would be pretty pointless to me.,605.79,2.19
"But it's actually closer to a
set of Super Res Zoom presets",607.98,3.6
"that you can actually then
digitally zoom between.",611.58,2.49
"I'll detail all of this
in the full reviews.",614.07,2.34
And here's some benchmark scores,616.41,2.64
"in case you're curious
about that sort of thing",619.05,1.56
"for performance for the A17 Pro,",620.61,1.77
which is actually new.,622.38,1.71
"But generally, I think that wraps up",624.09,1.71
"my first, second impressions,",625.8,2.04
"my second look now that
I got 'em in the studio.",627.84,2.49
"Really I feel like the base iPhone 15s,",630.33,3.39
"if you wanna buy one of
these or pre-order 'em,",633.72,2.35
"it's a bigger improvement
than it seems on paper.",636.99,3.27
"Like, nothing is actually new here,",640.26,2.61
"but because it's bringing things
from last year's Pro phone,",642.87,3.75
it's actually a very solid phone.,646.62,1.68
"And then the Pro, it's
a lot more interesting",648.3,3.21
"because there's some
genuinely new stuff happening.",651.51,2.52
I've seen new stuff with the cameras.,654.03,2.01
"Also, it seems like someone found out",656.04,2.01
"the batteries are slightly
bigger across the board,",658.05,1.92
which is good too.,659.97,0.9
We'll see if that holds up.,660.87,1.8
"But generally, let me know",662.67,0.87
what you wanna see in the full reviews,663.54,1.97
"in the comment section below,",665.51,1.09
because I will be working on those,666.6,1.71
"over the next couple days and weeks,",668.31,1.59
and hopefully you'll see that soon.,669.9,2.19
"Either way, thanks for watching.",672.09,2.1
Catch you in the next one.,674.19,0.833
Peace.,675.023,0.833
(mellow electronic music),676.741,3.5
if you zoom out to the iPhone 15 Pro and,0.299,4.441
15 Pro Max I think it's fair to say that,2.76,4.32
these are a fairly forgettable set of,4.74,4.439
phones there is no one big defining,7.08,3.599
feature that puts them on the map like,9.179,3.181
the dynamic Island was on the iPhone 14,10.679,3.84
Pros or the 120 hertz Pro motion,12.36,3.9
displays on the iPhone 13 Pros the,14.519,3.361
famous summary page that Apple makes for,16.26,3.0
each of their new products for this,17.88,2.88
phone half of it was filled with,19.26,3.0
features that were already well used to,20.76,3.599
there's not even a bold new color to,22.26,3.9
aesthetically differentiate itself this,24.359,4.141
is the single driest selection in recent,26.16,4.08
memory for me but it's only now that,28.5,3.3
I've started Living with it that I've,30.24,3.54
realized so many little things things,31.8,3.54
that are easy to miss things that Apple,33.78,3.54
didn't even mention that all add up to,35.34,3.66
make this a more surprising more,37.32,3.84
immediately beneficial experience than I,39.0,3.719
would say I've had with any iPhone I've,41.16,3.419
tested before this especially when it,42.719,3.241
comes to cameras in case you're,44.579,2.761
wondering by the way this is what you,45.96,3.72
get when you order a 15 Pro it's fairly,47.34,4.02
standard Apple fare no longer a black,49.68,3.42
box that you used to get with Pros I,51.36,3.9
imagine to use less ink inside you get,53.1,5.04
the phone the new USBC cable and the,55.26,4.5
little insert which has your sim ejector,58.14,3.12
tool manual and a couple of Apple,59.76,4.32
stickers now this cable is a bit of an,61.26,4.859
upgrade with this woven fiber around it,64.08,3.42
which is going to make it more durable,66.119,3.721
and is very very resistant to tangling,67.5,4.619
but just know that it isn't a fast cable,69.84,4.68
the iPhone 15 Pros are capable of USB 3,72.119,4.5
speeds I.E 20 times faster than,74.52,3.36
lightning used to be but with the,76.619,3.36
default cable you will not get them this,77.88,3.599
is pretty standard for most phones,79.979,2.82
though okay so the first thing about,81.479,2.881
these phones which I guess I didn't,82.799,3.061
realize the full potential of until,84.36,3.899
switching to the pro Max is the action,85.86,4.14
button this brand new programmable,88.259,3.36
button that sits in place of the Ring,90.0,3.54
silent switch that you can set to,91.619,3.781
whatever trigger you want and my heart,93.54,3.899
take when I first saw this was well you,95.4,3.6
can already program things to a triple,97.439,3.54
tap of your power button why bother,99.0,3.6
doing the same thing to a button that's,100.979,3.541
just much harder to reach and the hard,102.6,4.08
to reach part that hasn't changed it,104.52,4.02
still makes no sense to me why a button,106.68,4.02
designed around being a shortcut is so,108.54,3.48
far out of the radius of where your,110.7,3.0
fingers can reach in a normal grip,112.02,4.559
unless you use it for the camera I would,113.7,4.8
say that 80 of photos that I take on my,116.579,4.141
phone I do so in landscape mode and and,118.5,3.96
that works really well with the action,120.72,3.06
button because when you go like this,122.46,3.54
your finger is naturally resting on it,123.78,3.839
the button is designed so that you have,126.0,3.06
to hold for half a second or so to,127.619,3.541
activate I guess to reduce accidental,129.06,3.84
presses and then that activation can,131.16,3.659
take you immediately to not just the,132.9,3.839
camera but exactly the camera mode that,134.819,3.901
you want to be the default and then if,136.739,3.781
you do that the action button will also,138.72,3.72
double as your shutter button when you,140.52,4.02
get there which means this is now the,142.44,3.48
fastest way to be able to quickly record,144.54,3.839
a clip when the opportunity unexpectedly,145.92,4.5
arises it's not perfect because let's,148.379,3.72
say If instead of here the button was,150.42,3.3
actually up here that would mean that,152.099,2.941
you could properly grip the phone,153.72,2.64
without worrying that you're actually,155.04,3.36
covering the thing that's shooting the,156.36,3.959
photos plus you might find that for a,158.4,3.059
lot of commands it's actually much,160.319,3.121
easier to map them to the power button,161.459,4.14
or even the backtab feature which every,163.44,3.72
iPhone has but the point is action,165.599,3.661
button solid new feature has its uses,167.16,3.9
and also something Apple didn't really,169.26,3.72
mention but just kind of showed as part,171.06,3.179
of one of their slides was that the,172.98,2.7
iPhone 15 Pros are coming with a new,174.239,3.181
thread radio which may well make them,175.68,3.9
better at communicating with other Apple,177.42,4.56
Smart Home devices so I have no doubt,179.58,4.2
that people will find cool ways to use,181.98,3.6
this action button to even control the,183.78,4.02
home okay this is a phone let's talk,185.58,3.96
about call Quality we don't talk about,187.8,3.719
call Quality very much mostly because it,189.54,3.24
doesn't tend to change between,191.519,2.881
Generations but there is a really cool,192.78,3.539
new Improvement here to voice isolation,194.4,4.38
so I've got my fiance drisha on the line,196.319,5.881
right now she's using a 15 Pro and it,198.78,6.379
sounds terrible yeah,202.2,2.959
okay so let's try the voice isolation,205.22,4.5
[Music],213.67,3.53
without any noise it literally feels,215.4,3.18
like you've turned the tap off that's,217.2,3.56
crazy,218.58,2.18
there's a lot and while the voice,221.58,3.719
isolation won't improve the quality of,223.14,4.379
your speech it will pretty much erase,225.299,4.381
all background noise without reducing it,227.519,3.601
and then just like the new FaceTime,229.68,3.3
video effects what's quite cool is that,231.12,3.179
these voice effects because they're,232.98,2.819
happening on a hardware level they,234.299,3.241
persist whatever the software you're,235.799,3.181
using whether it's a normal call a,237.54,3.3
FaceTime call or a zoom call what I,238.98,2.88
would love is to be able to get this,240.84,3.3
working with Voice Notes too because I,241.86,4.86
mean clearly it can and that is like my,244.14,4.44
main form of communication nowadays okay,246.72,3.84
the phone also surprised me when it,248.58,3.96
comes to Performance naturally being the,250.56,3.42
nerd that I am one of the first things I,252.54,3.36
did was Run The geekbench Benchmark the,253.98,4.08
CPU in this new a17 Pro chip is coming,255.9,3.959
out about 10 faster and the graphic,258.06,3.84
score is up by 20 from last year which,259.859,5.34
is solid and in a way a bit surreal,261.9,4.68
because it's actually approaching the,265.199,3.361
graphics performance of the M2 powered,266.58,4.2
MacBooks but then at the same time if we,268.56,3.66
zoom out and look at what's happening in,270.78,3.419
the General market these are not out of,272.22,4.02
the ordinary generational leaps in power,274.199,4.681
but what was genuinely surprising is,276.24,4.679
that after a long time it finally feels,278.88,3.599
that we have something to do with that,280.919,2.941
power what you're seeing right now is,282.479,3.841
Resident Evil Village playing on an,283.86,4.619
iPhone and we've seen plenty of pretty,286.32,4.74
phone games before like Genji impact but,288.479,5.101
what is crazy about this is that this is,291.06,5.4
not Resident Evil Village mobile this is,293.58,5.16
Resident Evil the same Resident Evil,296.46,4.2
that you've seen on consoles all the,298.74,3.42
assets and the textures are taken,300.66,3.12
straight from the PlayStation 4 version,302.16,3.12
of the game and then it's pairing that,303.78,3.18
with some of the tech from the PS5,305.28,3.84
version of the game like HDR which is a,306.96,3.54
much higher brightness range than last,309.12,3.359
gen consoles could support now as,310.5,3.66
someone who has played this game on,312.479,3.72
current gen consoles holding it in my,314.16,3.96
hand not even on one of those bulky,316.199,3.961
handheld PCS with a battery life of two,318.12,4.74
hours on a smartphone is very impressive,320.16,5.34
it is only running at 720p resolution as,322.86,4.679
opposed to the 900p that the PlayStation,325.5,3.84
4 runs the game at but still the fact,327.539,3.66
that it is the same game that runs on a,329.34,4.079
box like this or a box like this on your,331.199,4.201
phone that fits in your pocket and also,333.419,3.78
includes the display the surround sound,335.4,3.84
speakers and everything else built in it,337.199,3.84
has definitely felt like one of those,339.24,4.2
feet of Technology moments excuse the,341.039,4.861
the dazzling so many times when I'm away,343.44,4.259
somewhere the only Gadget I have with me,345.9,4.019
is my phone and I just wish that I could,347.699,4.681
have some proper meaty offline single,349.919,3.72
player games that I could sink my teeth,352.38,3.72
into so if this whole console gaming on,353.639,4.021
a phone thing actually catches on now,356.1,4.02
I'm gonna be a very happy guy and you,357.66,4.56
probably won't see many Tech videos but,360.12,4.2
we don't know if it will yet there's,362.22,3.72
only four console games like this,364.32,3.599
currently announced exclusively for the,365.94,3.84
pro iPhone 15s one of them is the latest,367.919,4.381
Assassin's Creed which is very cool and,369.78,4.02
surreal because that game looks like,372.3,2.94
this but one of the games that I spent,373.8,2.88
growing up with on my PlayStation,375.24,3.54
Portable was also Assassin's Creed and,376.68,5.34
that looked like this but it does raise,378.78,5.94
questions like how easy is it to Port,382.02,4.44
over a PlayStation 4 game to an iPhone,384.72,3.84
how many will come after this initial,386.46,4.44
honeymoon period and will they also come,388.56,3.66
to Android phones later on because,390.9,3.18
powerful as this is the graphics,392.22,3.36
performance on the iPhone is not,394.08,3.239
dissimilar to what you get on the latest,395.58,3.899
Samsung we have no idea there is also,397.319,4.38
support for Wi-Fi 6E base into that,399.479,4.021
package which is basically a less,401.699,4.021
congested version of Wi-Fi 6 but does,403.5,4.199
need a router specifically with that,405.72,4.44
technology in mind okay let's talk about,407.699,4.56
the design right now where we are with,410.16,4.02
the iPhone 15 Pros,412.259,3.78
High Point we've just come from a set of,414.18,4.019
phones that were pretty yes but very,416.039,4.021
heavy and not comfy to a set of phones,418.199,2.94
that are just as pretty but more,420.06,2.699
comfortable thanks to the new contoured,421.139,3.06
edges much lighter thanks to the,422.759,3.541
material swap to Titanium not to mention,424.199,3.661
more practical thanks to having a matte,426.3,3.0
finish all the way around with the,427.86,3.66
iPhone 14 pro that I used to use the,429.3,4.56
fingerprinty stainless steel sides the,431.52,3.48
couple of marks I've got near my,433.86,3.119
charging port from where I've,435.0,4.38
well missed and the dust in the mute,436.979,4.081
slider are the only giveaways that this,439.38,4.259
is a well used phone but with these I,441.06,3.96
mean obviously we'll need about three,443.639,3.241
months to say anything conclusively but,445.02,3.299
it feels like the combination of having,446.88,3.96
both matte and brushed side rails should,448.319,4.201
help to hide that it's not the dream,450.84,3.0
though because even though the material,452.52,3.66
does hide scratches better it does look,453.84,4.919
like it can be scratched easier and also,456.18,4.44
fingerprints on these darker phones tend,458.759,3.78
to show up as a light area which means,460.62,3.78
that around your buttons you tend to,462.539,3.78
almost get this haloing effect from past,464.4,3.84
fingerprints that you struggle to wipe,466.319,3.481
away they're not permanent marks they'll,468.24,2.7
come off straight away if you go in,469.8,2.58
there with a cloth but you can't be,470.94,3.0
doing that every day so you will notice,472.38,3.12
it from time to time zooming out a,473.94,2.759
little I still think the most,475.5,3.12
comfortable shape that a phone can be is,476.699,3.72
pebble-like I've asked my whole family,478.62,3.479
and every person agreed that the iPhone,480.419,4.381
11 Pro is more comfy to hold and use,482.099,4.861
than the 15 Pro but then I suppose that,484.8,3.48
thing has its own set of issues because,486.96,2.459
the curved nature of the phone,488.28,3.6
introduces a bulge around the screen and,489.419,3.9
that's actually something the new phones,491.88,4.08
do especially well the bezels are really,493.319,4.44
really Slim So it's one of those things,495.96,3.72
that of course you will get used to the,497.759,3.181
same way you get used to the,499.68,3.12
acceleration of a new car or the sound,500.94,3.96
quality of a great audio system but then,502.8,3.899
anytime you get a hint of perspective,504.9,3.72
like seeing anyone else's older iPhone,506.699,4.141
it does make you reappreciate what I,508.62,4.62
think is a bit of a design feat okay so,510.84,3.9
I mentioned that cameras are something,513.24,3.9
pretty special on these phones and let's,514.74,3.84
be very clear about something what makes,517.14,3.66
these cameras special is no one thing in,518.58,3.959
isolation it's not about the ultroid,520.8,3.0
camera that lets in a bit more light,522.539,2.881
it's not about the new coating that,523.8,3.42
helps reduce the amount of lens flares,525.42,3.419
on this lens because honestly you still,527.22,2.94
get enough lens flares on the main,528.839,3.18
camera to account for both it's not any,530.16,3.299
of these pieces on their own but it's,532.019,3.721
how the whole thing works together as a,533.459,3.901
system that's even better than the sum,535.74,3.3
of its parts and this is the thing that,537.36,3.36
I've only now realized having used the,539.04,3.6
phones so for starters the iPhone 15,540.72,5.7
Pros take 24 megapixel photos again that,542.64,5.34
doesn't sound very impressive when you,546.42,2.88
think that the latest Samsung can take,547.98,3.24
up 200 megapixel shot but it's the fact,549.3,3.84
that the iPhone can do this 24 megapixel,551.22,4.32
by default that's the key thing that it,553.14,5.16
takes 24 megapixel in in auto mode with,555.54,4.56
no perceptible compromise that I can see,558.3,3.36
not in terms of the time taken to,560.1,2.88
capture not in terms of the dynamic,561.66,2.94
range of the image not in terms of the,562.98,2.88
amount of post-processing that happens,564.6,3.54
afterwards it's actually faster here to,565.86,4.32
take a 24 megapixel shot than it is for,568.14,4.08
most phones to take a 12 megapixel shot,570.18,3.719
which is the industry standard default,572.22,3.9
even four phones which have 200,573.899,4.201
megapixel camera sensors so that's one,576.12,3.719
part of it but then you've got the file,578.1,3.48
format most phones when they take photos,579.839,4.201
they output those photos as JPEG images,581.58,4.02
for quite a few years though the iPhone,584.04,3.78
instead uses a file format called Heat,585.6,4.2
which is really similar to JPEG and,587.82,3.6
image quality but with smaller file,589.8,3.84
sizes actually about half the size now,591.42,3.66
that the resolution of the photos has,593.64,3.12
gone up though the image size has gone,595.08,3.18
up with it but even though the,596.76,3.24
resolution has doubled the image size,598.26,3.6
has only gone up one point five times,600.0,3.899
which leaves you with this bizarre,601.86,4.32
situation where the 24 megapixel shots,603.899,4.62
taken here take up less space than the,606.18,4.56
12 megapixel shots on other phones oh,608.519,4.621
and that smaller file now also includes,610.74,4.38
both the portrait mode data and the live,613.14,4.139
photo data at the same time this is kind,615.12,3.6
of where it really started to click with,617.279,3.601
me because I think like motion photos in,618.72,4.02
general are an amazing feature I was,620.88,3.3
making a little video for drisher and,622.74,3.24
I's anniversary recently and the only,624.18,3.36
way that video was possible was because,625.98,3.66
for every photo I take an obvious the,627.54,4.14
phone was also storing the entire scene,629.64,3.54
just before that shot was captured and,631.68,2.88
so long as you're doing that it is super,633.18,3.36
quick to then save that motion as its,634.56,3.6
own video which you can put into a,636.54,3.66
longer project then I also love portrait,638.16,3.48
mode every single time I'm trying to,640.2,3.24
take a nice photo for someone else I,641.64,3.66
will take like three normal shots and,643.44,3.36
then I'll take a separate set of three,645.3,3.42
portrait shots to let them decide which,646.8,3.12
one they prefer because they're almost,648.72,2.94
two very different propositions the,649.92,3.359
normal shot is very practical and,651.66,3.78
utilitarian and then the portrait shot,653.279,4.441
is very cinematic all of that extra time,655.44,4.2
all of that faff and all about having to,657.72,4.559
think is just gone because you don't,659.64,4.56
need to be in portrait mode to take,662.279,3.901
portraits you just take the photo as you,664.2,3.72
always do and as soon as a person a dog,666.18,3.599
or a cat appears in the image this,667.92,3.9
little F will pop up when that F pops up,669.779,3.481
you know that you are automatically,671.82,3.42
capturing depth information and that you,673.26,3.54
can go back into the shot after you've,675.24,3.48
taken it to tweak the level of portrait,676.8,4.26
mode you want to apply again in 24,678.72,4.799
megapixels so double the resolution that,681.06,4.56
portrait mode used to be the F will also,683.519,4.081
come up if you ever tap to focus because,685.62,3.3
then the phone knows that you're trying,687.6,2.88
to focus on something in particular,688.92,3.24
which means that even if you miss focus,690.48,3.419
on that subject in the moment you can go,692.16,3.96
back in afterwards and tweak it and so,693.899,3.661
what I'm really getting to here is that,696.12,2.64
Apple has managed to build with the,697.56,3.3
iPhone 15 Pros a camera system for which,698.76,4.139
all you have to think about is just this,700.86,4.2
one thing is it framed the way that I,702.899,4.021
want it to be the rest is done for you,705.06,4.08
as well as now photonic engine this was,706.92,3.9
introduced last year as a level of,709.14,3.42
processing applied to each image to add,710.82,3.48
in extra detail and fix up the colors,712.56,3.66
but when it was announced it wasn't for,714.3,3.24
all camera modes for things like,716.22,2.88
portraits and night mode which already,717.54,3.66
required a lot of processing that wasn't,719.1,4.32
Headroom to also have the photonic,721.2,4.319
engine going on not anymore it now works,723.42,3.419
in portrait mode it works in night mode,725.519,2.82
it works on the front camera and it,726.839,3.361
works on every single magnification of,728.339,4.081
the rear camera and you can really tell,730.2,3.72
the difference like I went out a couple,732.42,3.0
of days ago to get some shots of the,733.92,3.12
night sky and while sometimes between,735.42,3.78
iPhone Generations you do struggle to,737.04,3.6
notice the difference the improvements,739.2,3.06
here are at a glance instantly,740.64,3.18
recognizable and the other thing that,742.26,4.139
they've addressed is HDR HDR in photos,743.82,4.68
is one of Apple's historic long-running,746.399,3.541
weaknesses I think it originates from,748.5,2.88
the fact that Apple doesn't want to over,749.94,3.72
process images but the truth is in a lot,751.38,4.019
of cases like when you have really harsh,753.66,3.96
backlighting behind you you kind of have,755.399,4.56
to well it's better here I wouldn't say,757.62,4.02
that Apple's completely solved all,759.959,3.301
instances of parts of the image being,761.64,3.48
Overexposed but at the same time I,763.26,3.24
didn't expect a difference this,765.12,3.24
noticeable versus last year's phone you,766.5,3.24
can tell on the rear camera and you can,768.36,3.36
also tell on the front camera so do you,769.74,3.0
kind of see what I'm saying about these,771.72,3.299
cameras this idea that no individual,772.74,4.14
aspect is particularly groundbreaking or,775.019,3.661
new it's just the fact that it all comes,776.88,3.959
together in the highest quality lowest,778.68,4.68
hassle way that I've ever seen with by,780.839,4.381
the way the smoothest operating version,783.36,3.779
of the camera app that I've ever seen on,785.22,3.78
a phone or within like a three megabyte,787.139,5.0
file now is,789.0,3.139
how Apple's trying to pitch this thing,792.18,3.599
as seven lenses in your pocket there's,793.68,3.899
some truth to it but you can't really,795.779,3.901
take that statement at face value see,797.579,3.901
the way it works is the iPhone 15 Pros,799.68,4.02
have a 48 megapixel main camera sensor,801.48,4.08
if you tap on this one time zoom it'll,803.7,3.3
cycle between three different focal,805.56,4.8
lengths between 1X and 1.5 x now because,807.0,5.579
the camera is 48 megapixel and you're,810.36,4.86
outputting images in 24 megapixel you,812.579,5.401
can between 1X and 1.5 x Zoom use,815.22,4.859
different amounts of this full sensor to,817.98,4.02
achieve a result that is still genuinely,820.079,4.5
a 24 megapixel shot and so on the bright,822.0,4.38
side when you take let's say a 35,824.579,4.2
millimeter photo it is more detailed,826.38,4.079
than if you just took a 1x shot and,828.779,3.18
zoomed in till it looked like a 35,830.459,3.18
millimeter photo but then the downside,831.959,3.18
is that when you do this you're not,833.639,3.361
using the full extent of your sensor and,835.139,3.601
therefore the image quality isn't as,837.0,3.42
high I wouldn't say the degradation is,838.74,3.96
noticeable but it will be there and it's,840.42,4.44
just a bit icky to call this a 7 lens,842.7,3.9
system when really if you're going to do,844.86,3.96
that you could just add a stop at every,846.6,3.72
single possible different magnification,848.82,3.78
and then call it a thousand camera,850.32,4.139
system as a feature it's fine it does,852.6,3.72
the job but unlike the way it's being,854.459,4.261
presented it is not the same as actually,856.32,4.8
having seven lenses right now let's talk,858.72,4.08
about the new zoom camera so for the,861.12,3.839
iPhone 15 Pro Max only the three times,862.8,4.02
optical zoom lens camera has become a,864.959,3.661
five times optical zoom lens camera and,866.82,3.66
this is a bigger upgrade than it,868.62,3.839
initially seems they've not just taken,870.48,3.299
the zoom camera that was already on the,872.459,3.18
pro and stuck a bigger lens on it the,873.779,3.901
pro Max has a larger sensor and better,875.639,3.841
stabilization than the regular Pro too,877.68,3.599
and let's be very clear even though five,879.48,3.299
times Zoom is not the highest,881.279,2.941
magnification we've ever seen on a phone,882.779,3.541
by a long shot this is still a very good,884.22,3.96
quality five-time zoom camera which,886.32,3.42
means that in most lighting conditions,888.18,3.719
the shots look pretty good even at 10x,889.74,3.959
and the lens has so much natural,891.899,3.601
foreground background separation that,893.699,3.841
oftentimes you don't even need to rely,895.5,3.959
on portrait mode for that DSLR like,897.54,4.2
separation and check this this is a,899.459,4.021
one-time Zoom portrait taken on the 15,901.74,4.14
Pro Max notice how much Distortion there,903.48,4.859
is on my face taking a portrait at 3x is,905.88,4.019
far more flattering because you get to,908.339,3.901
be further away and then 5X fsos,909.899,4.8
slightly even more flattering than a 3X,912.24,5.399
so it has a purpose and it's just a fun,914.699,5.401
tool to have because 5x feels like such,917.639,4.2
a distinct image to what a one x image,920.1,3.359
looks like and you don't have to step,921.839,3.481
back as much as I was expecting to fit,923.459,2.94
the person that you're trying to shoot,925.32,3.48
in the frame but it is still very much a,926.399,4.921
trade see the way the main camera sensor,928.8,4.32
on this phone works you can only get,931.32,3.959
so-called lossless zoom in between 1X,933.12,4.56
and 2x and so the entire gap between,935.279,4.8
your 2X and your 5x Zoom range now that,937.68,4.56
relies on pure digital Zoom which is why,940.079,3.901
in these shots the 3x image while,942.24,3.48
fluttering is definitely the weakest,943.98,3.78
quality and as you get to like 4.9 x,945.72,4.2
like just before the 5x optical zoom,947.76,3.96
camera kicks in it does start to look a,949.92,3.84
bit rough also worth bearing in mind the,951.72,4.02
optical zoom cameras on both the pro and,953.76,4.439
the pro max they're not 24 megapixel,955.74,4.5
they're so 12 as is the ultrawide lens,958.199,4.021
which is pretty normal for a phone but,960.24,3.12
it just feels like one of the only,962.22,3.239
slight remaining inconsistencies but,963.36,3.479
camera comparison versus the Samsung,965.459,3.06
coming very shortly so if you want to,966.839,2.881
see that then he's sub to the channel,968.519,4.26
would be Mega,969.72,5.96
pixel,972.779,2.901
now based on some browsing on X,976.88,7.54
people are worried about battery and,981.92,4.779
rightly so the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro,984.42,4.14
Max had insane battery for their,986.699,4.2
prospective sizes but then the 14s were,988.56,4.079
not as good and they also seem to,990.899,3.721
degrade faster over time now that could,992.639,3.301
be a few different things it could be,994.62,3.779
the iOS 17 beta that was pretty rough on,995.94,3.899
battery it could be the extra brightness,998.399,3.36
of the screen putting more pressure on,999.839,3.541
the battery and causing more heat on the,1001.759,3.541
inside which can permanently degrade,1003.38,3.72
your cell whatever it was Apple didn't,1005.3,3.479
really acknowledge or address any,1007.1,3.539
battery concern so it's not clear if any,1008.779,3.0
of those long-term effects will be,1010.639,2.76
present but what I can say is that the,1011.779,3.901
iPhone 15 Pros are better for sure than,1013.399,3.841
the 14 Pros with a bigger battery,1015.68,3.779
capacity even more mature software and,1017.24,3.779
better heat dissipation which should,1019.459,3.12
make that battery last longer over time,1021.019,3.121
but as well as a camera test there will,1022.579,2.941
also be a very detailed battery test,1024.14,3.72
alongside it so there will be a lot to,1025.52,3.84
talk about there I am slightly sad to,1027.86,2.88
see that the charging speed hasn't gone,1029.36,3.18
up which would have been one of the main,1030.74,4.14
perks of a USB 3 Port but at least the,1032.54,3.779
phone does leverage some of the,1034.88,3.9
capability of USBC with the ability to,1036.319,4.14
reverse charge your airpods what,1038.78,3.419
actually is great news and what I'm,1040.459,3.0
really surprised Apple didn't talk about,1042.199,2.821
at the event was that it's not just,1043.459,3.421
airpods the fact that your iPhone 15s,1045.02,3.84
can now deliver power through USBC means,1046.88,3.24
that almost anything that you can plug,1048.86,3.36
this cable into you can charge which,1050.12,3.48
means that for the first time since,1052.22,2.88
switching to the iPhone like four years,1053.6,3.36
ago I don't have to feel like I'm the,1055.1,3.72
battery lead in my friend group I guess,1056.96,4.26
the main perk of iPhone being USBC now,1058.82,5.64
is some semblance of stability this move,1061.22,5.16
was always on the horizon it always felt,1064.46,3.3
like it could be just next year when,1066.38,3.419
Apple switched over and so now that it,1067.76,4.08
has just happened you can safely invest,1069.799,4.5
in some USBC accessories that you know,1071.84,4.199
won't become outdated for at least a,1074.299,4.021
couple of years but probably more I know,1076.039,3.541
there's been a lot of rumors about the,1078.32,4.02
portless iPhone but honestly I I just,1079.58,4.08
think they're a long way off there are,1082.34,2.699
so many things that would suffer if,1083.66,3.36
Apple made that move anytime soon like,1085.039,3.841
being able to listen to proper lossless,1087.02,4.14
music being able to transfer massive,1088.88,4.02
prores video files which apple is,1091.16,3.36
touting as one of the new features that,1092.9,3.3
you should use as well as all kinds of,1094.52,3.12
really Niche things like using your,1096.2,3.78
phone as a screen to Pilot a drone where,1097.64,4.38
you need the lowest latency possible in,1099.98,4.14
order to bring this all together then we,1102.02,3.779
need to consider the prices for the,1104.12,3.6
iPhone 15s the pro is staying at its,1105.799,4.321
price of 999 and the pro Max is going up,1107.72,5.76
by 100 to 11.99 to which I would say I,1110.12,5.16
think the normal Pro is in a really good,1113.48,3.3
place right now it's an iterator phone,1115.28,3.48
but one that ties together a lot of the,1116.78,3.36
Loose Ends that Apple has had over the,1118.76,3.0
years integrating all the bitty camera,1120.14,3.419
features together sanding down the,1121.76,3.6
rougher edges of the design and bringing,1123.559,3.181
a little lift to the battery while it's,1125.36,3.9
at it the pro Max is a bit of a harder,1126.74,4.08
pill to swallow since the only,1129.26,3.12
additional difference for the extra,1130.82,3.359
hundred dollar Gap in price is more,1132.38,4.08
storage and your 3x lens becoming a 5x,1134.179,4.5
lens which is an upgrade but not a,1136.46,3.719
massive one and one that in some,1138.679,3.12
situations can leave you with worse,1140.179,3.661
shots than the 3x but that does not,1141.799,4.081
invalidate it the 15 Pro Max is still,1143.84,3.959
the phone for people who want the best,1145.88,3.48
iPhone it's the phone that I've already,1147.799,3.601
switched to especially because of the,1149.36,4.08
battery and also important note the,1151.4,3.779
phone isn't actually necessarily more,1153.44,3.54
expensive if the quoted prices Apple,1155.179,4.021
gives are always us but like here in the,1156.98,4.5
UK the 15 Pro Max is the same price as,1159.2,4.8
the 14 pro Max and that's the 14 pro Max,1161.48,5.1
with half the storage okay we'll see you,1164.0,5.24
in the comparisons,1166.58,2.66
hey guys Anton Tech Chap and I'm filming,0.0,4.62
this entire review on the new iPhone 15,2.34,4.559
pro and pro Max so let me know what you,4.62,3.66
make of it does it look like it's been,6.899,3.601
shot on iPhone and actually if I show,8.28,3.899
you what I'm looking at you can see this,10.5,3.78
is my producer James with the 15 Pro,12.179,7.621
recording his new 4k 60 prores onto an,14.28,7.98
SSD plugged into the USB port so for me,19.8,4.08
actually the new USB C Port is,22.26,3.54
incredibly helpful because I can,23.88,4.08
transfer files off we're talking like 10,25.8,5.34
gigs per minute at 4k60 Pro is plug it,27.96,5.64
in your laptop and Away you go,31.14,4.62
but as well as being able to shoot 4K 60,33.6,4.139
prores for the first time on new iPhone,35.76,4.26
15 Pros you can also Now record in HDR,37.739,4.441
and log now I still don't think an,40.02,3.96
iPhone is going to replace your fancy,42.18,3.96
mirrorless or DSLR camera but you know,43.98,3.419
often the best camera is the one you,46.14,2.939
have in your pocket it's a good tool to,47.399,3.541
have although I would be it's kind of,49.079,3.3
surprised if my I don't know,50.94,3.54
professional wedding videographer turned,52.379,3.601
up to my wedding shooting on an iPhone,54.48,3.84
but with the new options you have with,55.98,3.719
the higher quality video and photos,58.32,3.18
which we'll come back to in a second oh,59.699,3.961
I just got bright it's a pretty big step,61.5,3.059
up,63.66,3.12
anyway enough about prores the headline,64.559,4.141
upgrade with the new 15 series is the,66.78,4.74
switch to USBC the ubiquity the,68.7,5.58
universality of USBC how every MacBook,71.52,4.86
iPad well except the cheapest 9th gen,74.28,4.08
model every Windows laptop Android phone,76.38,3.9
and every charging port in new cars,78.36,4.259
they're all type c and while you could,80.28,4.199
faff around with adapters or just rely,82.619,3.901
on wireless charging and airdrop going,84.479,3.541
forward it means if you run out of,86.52,3.239
battery on your iPhone 15 and your,88.02,3.599
friends or Android then you can use the,89.759,4.68
same charging cable and vice versa now I,91.619,5.221
had hoped the switch to USBC may have,94.439,4.981
meant we'd also get faster charging but,96.84,4.8
alas no still tops out 20 watts with,99.42,3.839
Apple's charger which of course doesn't,101.64,3.24
come bundled in the Box although you do,103.259,3.661
get the nice CTC braided cable now and,104.88,3.84
also the regular 15s not the pros,106.92,4.379
actually have a USB 2.0 spec rather than,108.72,4.679
3.0 so the same speed as the old lining,111.299,3.541
connector so it feels like a little,113.399,3.781
half-hearted sort of switch to USBC,114.84,3.66
although there are other benefits,117.18,2.939
obviously we've got this transfer of,118.5,3.36
footage that I'm recording prores on,120.119,3.481
right now also you can now output to a,121.86,4.74
TV or monitor at 4 4K 60 HDR previously,123.6,4.92
topped out at 1080p 30 although I'm not,126.6,3.48
sure if Apple made this switch out of,128.52,3.0
the pure goodness of their heart so,130.08,3.0
everything could be Universal and lovely,131.52,3.18
I think it had something to do with the,133.08,3.54
EU regulations coming in next year which,134.7,3.96
kind of forced them to switch to USBC if,136.62,3.24
they wanted to keep selling these phones,138.66,3.36
in Europe but regardless of why they did,139.86,4.379
it it is certainly a nice upgrade it,142.02,3.359
will take a minute for Apple's,144.239,3.36
accessories to catch up only the airpods,145.379,4.201
Pro 2 have been refreshed with a USBC,147.599,4.681
case all other airpods the Max's Apple's,149.58,4.379
power bank and obviously still their Mac,152.28,4.2
peripherals only updating but I suspect,153.959,4.381
that'll happen pretty quickly and I'm,156.48,3.6
also excited by all the new third-party,158.34,3.42
accessories and charges coming out that,160.08,4.26
will work with well everything but,161.76,4.74
there's a lot more here than just USBC,164.34,4.14
and some fancy video options although,166.5,3.42
I'll come back to the camera in just a,168.48,4.259
second let's talk about this design and,169.92,4.679
while on the face of it not a whole lot,172.739,4.561
has changed in the last well four years,174.599,4.86
I guess since the iPhone 11 Pro with the,177.3,3.659
most obvious refresh being last year's,179.459,3.241
Dynamic Island which I'm pleased to see,180.959,3.481
has made its way to the regular iPhone 7,182.7,4.02
scenes now and it is a genuinely useful,184.44,4.26
little notification bar especially as,186.72,3.42
more apps have now been optimized to use,188.7,3.24
it I'll tell you what though the first,190.14,3.54
thing you notice how much lighter this,191.94,4.2
is the 15 Pros have a new titanium band,193.68,4.5
Around The Edge and together with an,196.14,4.08
aluminum frame inside actually reduces,198.18,5.639
The Weight by 19 grams 240 221 and,200.22,5.28
particularly with the pro Max which is a,203.819,3.961
pretty chunky phone it is a very welcome,205.5,4.2
upgrade they've also slimmed down the,207.78,3.539
bezels and it means they've been able to,209.7,3.24
reduce the overall size of the phone,211.319,3.661
it's almost a millimeter narrower and,212.94,3.9
shorter although it is about half a,214.98,3.179
millimeter thicker but they've,216.84,3.959
maintained the same 6.1 and 6.7 inch,218.159,4.8
screen sizes Apple have also slightly,220.799,4.02
contoured just the corners of the frame,222.959,3.36
here on the back so it's a little bit,224.819,3.0
smoother and sits in your hand a bit,226.319,3.181
more comfortably although it is quite,227.819,3.661
subtle and as someone who used the 14,229.5,4.019
pro Max as their main phone for most of,231.48,4.08
last year these changes do add up to,233.519,3.061
make it just a little bit more,235.56,3.12
comfortable to use we also get a couple,236.58,3.659
of new colors this is the natural,238.68,3.9
titanium which for my money I think is,240.239,4.92
the best new flavor it's kind of of,242.58,5.28
Stony grayish color we also get a dark,245.159,5.101
blue a black and a white although more,247.86,4.14
importantly they've actually redesigned,250.26,3.839
the Intel frame and layout of the 15,252.0,4.44
Pros so the back glass can now be,254.099,4.32
repaired much more easily and crucially,256.44,4.079
much more cheaply than before,258.419,4.141
I've also just realized this is going to,260.519,4.74
be my 1 000th video on YouTube we're at,262.56,5.22
999 this is my next video,265.259,4.5
holy moly a thousand videos if you,267.78,3.18
haven't already subscribed I feel like,269.759,2.701
now is a pretty good time let's see what,270.96,4.38
happens over the next thousand videos,272.46,5.4
I'm gonna be so old,275.34,4.32
anyway back to the iPhone and let's talk,277.86,3.96
about this action button it is still a,279.66,3.78
mute switch by default you just long,281.82,3.12
press it to change between loud and,283.44,3.36
silent and the dynamic Island will also,284.94,3.78
react to the change and if you are muted,286.8,3.119
you'll also be able to see the icon at,288.72,3.0
the top left of the screen but now you,289.919,3.301
can customize it to do pretty much,291.72,3.84
anything torch voice recording launch an,293.22,3.84
app although I reckon for most of us,295.56,3.419
myself included you'll just make it the,297.06,3.66
shortcut for the camera and then it also,298.979,3.78
acts as a shutter button yes the volume,300.72,4.56
down does also work as a shutter but you,302.759,4.261
can do anything with it really and I,305.28,3.3
also appreciate that you can use this to,307.02,3.179
toggle on or off a lot of accessibility,308.58,3.36
settings I think for some people this,310.199,4.761
will be a really big deal,311.94,3.02
don't get too close to me when I'm,315.56,3.76
cooking babe,317.88,4.02
I'm playing a preview of Resident Evil,319.32,4.92
Village using what I'm told are PS4,321.9,5.76
assets natively on the 15 Pro Max albeit,324.24,6.84
at 720p and 30fps and well low to medium,327.66,5.46
settings but still for our phone this is,331.08,3.72
incredible and for now at least it's,333.12,4.2
only possible with the new Apple a17 Pro,334.8,4.739
chip that powers the new 15 pro and pro,337.32,4.2
Max which also happens to be the first,339.539,3.961
three nanometer architecture chip we've,341.52,3.78
had on a mobile we're also going to have,343.5,3.72
the likes of Resident Evil 4 remake,345.3,4.14
death stranding the division Resurgence,347.22,4.199
and even next year Assassin's Creed,349.44,4.14
Mirage which is the first time a full,351.419,3.78
console version of an Assassin's game,353.58,3.839
will be on mobile definitely recommend a,355.199,4.261
controller though this is the backbone,357.419,5.101
one for Playstation Android although,359.46,6.06
they do now sell an iOS USBC version for,362.52,4.86
the iPhone 15 highly recommend because,365.52,3.42
playing Resident Evil village with the,367.38,4.379
virtual touchscreen controls isn't ideal,368.94,4.86
so it's all pretty exciting because yes,371.759,4.561
we have the usual 10 bump in processor,373.8,4.08
performance we actually get double the,376.32,2.939
neural engine performance but these,377.88,3.42
these are kind of just abstract upgrades,379.259,3.72
that we see year on year and really make,381.3,3.3
a noticeable difference but the reason,382.979,4.321
the a17 pro is called the pro is because,384.6,4.56
of this completely redesigned Graphics,387.3,4.14
chip the GPU which is not only a lot,389.16,3.9
more powerful but supports features like,391.44,4.259
Hardware Ray tracing which isn't new,393.06,5.16
you're right the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the,395.699,4.801
flagship Dimension 9200 I believe is,398.22,4.259
from mediatek they both support Hardware,400.5,3.479
Ray tracing actually we're going to have,402.479,3.241
new versions of both those chips like,403.979,4.141
next month so they will compete with the,405.72,4.14
a17 pro hopefully it means more,408.12,3.6
developers will actually make use of it,409.86,3.119
in their games,411.72,3.539
now as strong as these new titanium,412.979,4.621
frame phones are they can still break,415.259,4.681
they can still fall out your pocket off,417.6,4.62
tables so I've teamed up with the lovely,419.94,4.62
folks over at caseify who have sent me a,422.22,5.759
whole range of new cases to protect my,424.56,5.759
iPhones so case if I have refreshed,427.979,4.141
their lineup for the new iPhone 15 and,430.319,4.32
15 pros and I've got three of the most,432.12,4.44
popular models here I've got the impact,434.639,3.9
the bounce and their brand new,436.56,5.1
ultrabounce each tougher than the last,438.539,5.701
and in case you're wondering uh yeah my,441.66,5.52
real name is Tom and not the tech Jab,444.24,5.28
and what I really do like about caseify,447.18,4.62
is how they combine the creativity and,449.52,4.2
the personality of their cases I mean,451.8,3.78
there are literally so many options to,453.72,3.36
choose from and you can customize your,455.58,4.559
own with proper tough protection in fact,457.08,4.98
all case defy protective cases are,460.139,4.021
aligned with their Eco shock material,462.06,4.199
which increases protection and also,464.16,3.539
makes them able to absorb more of the,466.259,3.241
shock if you happen to be a little bit,467.699,3.601
clumsy and knock your phone off your,469.5,5.4
desk over and over and over again and,471.3,6.0
actually the impact case meets the 4X,474.9,4.799
military grade we get 5x on the ultra,477.3,4.619
impact six on the bounce and a whopping,479.699,4.381
10x on the ultra bounce which is the,481.919,3.78
strongest case they have ever created,484.08,3.36
and it also has a built-in lens,485.699,3.541
protector for the camera you can,487.44,3.36
literally drop this thing from over 30,489.24,3.899
feet and maybe I will but I'll save that,490.8,4.44
for my next video just make sure you,493.139,4.081
pair a case to find case with a screen,495.24,3.48
protector though because even if your,497.22,3.36
phone survives a fall you don't want,498.72,3.78
that screen to be scratched so they're,500.58,3.78
tough they look good and case if I are,502.5,3.06
making their products even more,504.36,2.58
sustainable and environmentally friendly,505.56,3.72
than ever so before you're showing your,506.94,4.259
iPhone arrives click my link in the,509.28,4.199
description below to get 15 off your,511.199,4.921
next order at caseify Now versus last,513.479,5.581
year's 14 Pros the new 15 Pro and Promax,516.12,4.68
get an extra two gigs of RAM so we're,519.06,3.539
now up to eight gigabytes and of course,520.8,3.9
we have that new a17 Pro chip replacing,522.599,4.381
the a16 bionic and in this 3dmark,524.7,4.079
Wildlife extreme test we're looking at,526.98,3.96
around a 25 optic in performance,528.779,4.5
although in this new solar Bay Benchmark,530.94,4.56
which includes Ray tracing it's 44,533.279,5.041
faster however if we switch back but run,535.5,4.92
the 20 minute stress test the stability,538.32,4.26
is lower the new chip throttles more,540.42,3.72
although it's still eight percent faster,542.58,3.3
even at its lowest score but you can,544.14,4.259
also see the 15 Pro Max lost 5 of its,545.88,4.32
battery versus just two percent on the,548.399,3.901
14 pro Max during this test although,550.2,3.54
we'll talk more about battery in just a,552.3,3.479
second but actually even versus last,553.74,3.9
year's 14 pro Max which is to say I've,555.779,3.661
been using pretty much every day this,557.64,4.319
does feel noticeably nippier more,559.44,4.26
responsive apps seem to load Just a,561.959,3.481
Touch quicker and also I haven't had any,563.7,3.18
of those sort of random slowdowns or,565.44,3.36
stuff says that did occasionally crop up,566.88,4.079
on my 14 pro it's also a big deal,568.8,4.38
because the 15 Pros are the only phones,570.959,3.841
for now at least that will run these,573.18,3.599
upcoming console level games this does,574.8,4.32
now support Wi-Fi 6E although you will,576.779,4.981
of course need a compatible 6E router to,579.12,4.8
make best use of it but overall I would,581.76,4.079
say it's a solid step up and with the,583.92,4.32
new graphics chip along with USBC it,585.839,4.321
makes this one of the most future-proof,588.24,4.68
iPhones we've had in years,590.16,4.619
okay before we dive into the camera,592.92,3.72
which I know you're waiting to see I,594.779,3.481
just want to mention the battery life,596.64,3.54
because we didn't see the much rumored,598.26,4.139
increase in battery size but for the,600.18,4.62
first time the 15 support the G2,602.399,4.44
standard so if you have a new G2,604.8,4.32
wireless charger or power bank that can,606.839,4.861
now match the magsay's 15 watts double,609.12,4.74
the previous 7.5 which is a nice little,611.7,4.8
upgrade and actually even though Apple,613.86,5.28
claim the new 15 series will have the,616.5,5.399
same battery as the 14 series that's not,619.14,5.04
been quite my experience so far after an,621.899,3.841
hour of YouTube an hour of tick tock,624.18,3.48
half an hour of gaming and 15 minutes of,625.74,4.92
shooting 4k60 both the 15 pro and pro,627.66,5.22
Max were three percentage points lower,630.66,5.04
than the 14 pro and pro Max all phones,632.88,4.5
with 100 battery capacity and actually,635.7,3.96
bought these two 14 Pros last week so,637.38,3.84
they're all brand new like the 15s,639.66,3.179
although more importantly what I'm very,641.22,3.54
keen to see is how the battery health,642.839,4.381
fares over time because my iPhone 14 pro,644.76,4.38
Max which I've been using for a year is,647.22,5.04
down to 88 of its battery health now to,649.14,4.8
be fair other Brands don't really share,652.26,3.06
that information so there's not a lot to,653.94,3.06
compare it to but I do know versus,655.32,3.72
previous iPhones I've used for a long,657.0,3.839
time that degradation in battery,659.04,3.72
capacity is a lot faster it's more,660.839,3.721
significant so I'm hoping there's,662.76,3.66
improvements with this obviously it'll,664.56,3.899
take a while to figure that out,666.42,5.46
trying to get a photo no more I'm out if,668.459,5.281
I bring up the camera specs for both you,671.88,3.42
can see the main Hardware change this,673.74,3.42
year is that the optical zoom with the,675.3,3.779
pro Max is getting a new five times,677.16,3.96
telephoto whereas the pro is sticking,679.079,3.901
with three times aside from that the,681.12,3.959
hardware is pretty similar same sensors,682.98,4.2
and same resolutions as last year's 14,685.079,3.361
Pros,687.18,3.3
however there is more to the story with,688.44,3.959
some pretty big software and processing,690.48,3.18
improvements,692.399,3.721
for example the iPhone 15 Pros now,693.66,5.16
combine your usual four into one pixel,696.12,5.399
bins 12 megapixel photo with a full fat,698.82,5.34
48 megapixel photo giving us a more,701.519,5.401
detailed 24 megapixel shot and also,704.16,4.739
despite having double the megapixels the,706.92,3.9
file size of each photo is only about 50,708.899,3.601
bigger,710.82,3.3
Apple have also introduced three,712.5,3.54
different focal length options for the,714.12,3.48
main camera so you've got the default,716.04,3.84
one times which is 24 millimeters tap,717.6,4.58
once for 28 and tap again for 35,719.88,5.519
equivalent to a 1 1.2 and 1.5 times,722.18,5.44
optical zoom using some clever cropping,725.399,4.68
of that 48 megapixel sensor this is,727.62,4.08
definitely aimed at more Enthusiast,730.079,3.241
photographers who have a particular,731.7,3.54
focal length in mind although it's a,733.32,3.42
shame these new focal length options,735.24,3.719
don't transfer over to video,736.74,4.08
but I reckon one of the most exciting,738.959,3.961
new features is how even in the regular,740.82,4.079
photo mode if the camera detects a face,742.92,3.78
a cat or a dog or even if you just,744.899,3.421
simply tap on a subject it will now,746.7,3.36
capture a depth map so you can actually,748.32,4.019
turn this regular photo into a portrait,750.06,3.719
where you can then adjust the bokeh,752.339,4.021
level and also the focal point so if you,753.779,4.441
see this little f-stop icon pop up then,756.36,3.3
you know it's capturing the portrait,758.22,3.179
info and you can tap it if you want to,759.66,3.479
preview that bokeh,761.399,3.361
and then if you press edit on the photo,763.139,3.481
there is this new portrait button that,764.76,3.78
turns it into a portrait with that tasty,766.62,3.42
background blur,768.54,3.299
so the idea is you don't have to worry,770.04,3.239
about whether I should take a regular,771.839,3.901
photo or a portrait which previously had,773.279,4.081
higher shutter lag and missed out on,775.74,3.899
Smart HDR because now with these next,777.36,4.2
Generation portraits as Apple calls it,779.639,3.901
portraits now use the same photonic,781.56,3.719
engine pipeline so their fancy,783.54,3.78
background processing as a regular photo,785.279,4.141
so there's no compromise in quality or,787.32,4.079
shutter lag and for me this is one of,789.42,3.539
the most significant camera upgrades,791.399,2.94
this year,792.959,3.18
night mode shots as well as the new,794.339,3.481
portraits also benefit from Apple's,796.139,3.601
fancy photonic engine and deep Fusion,797.82,3.48
processing now and according to Apple,799.74,3.36
we're looking at up to two times better,801.3,4.02
low light quality and the latest smart,803.1,4.56
hdr5 processing should improve dynamic,805.32,4.319
range color and detail across all,807.66,4.679
cameras and modes up front we have the,809.639,4.741
same 12 megapixel true depth selfie,812.339,3.781
camera as before but this also gets,814.38,3.66
next-gen portraits so again your regular,816.12,3.779
selfies can now be turned into portraits,818.04,3.359
after the fact plus we get all the,819.899,4.141
benefits of that new smart hdr5 as for,821.399,4.081
video the main difference now is that,824.04,3.72
you can shoot that prores at 4k60 we,825.48,4.2
have new log and HDR options and the,827.76,3.48
video quality particularly low light,829.68,4.459
should be improved,831.24,2.899
now usually the selfie camera gets,835.56,4.2
forgotten uh in many phones but not so,837.54,3.72
much with the iPhone and also not so,839.76,3.0
much with video and actually this can,841.26,4.8
also shoot a 4k60 also known prores with,842.76,5.879
login HDR yes it's lower megapixel than,846.06,4.38
a rear camera but it has pretty much all,848.639,4.561
the same features as well as small HDR,850.44,6.0
and the next gen portraits for photos so,853.2,5.1
all that sounds great but is the camera,856.44,3.839
quality really that much better than,858.3,3.539
last year well let me show you a few,860.279,3.12
side by sides and also make sure you,861.839,3.18
have subscribed as I have a full camera,863.399,4.021
comparison with the Galaxy s23 Ultra in,865.019,4.5
the works but my takeaway is that there,867.42,4.08
isn't a huge amount in it I think the,869.519,3.961
most obvious change is how the 15 Pros,871.5,3.779
lean towards a warmer white balance,873.48,3.299
which I would say is a little bit more,875.279,3.601
accurate some shots are also noticeably,876.779,4.5
less over sharpened some photos on the,878.88,4.079
14s look like someone's just turned the,881.279,3.481
clarity slider up in Lightroom too far,882.959,3.841
now photos look more natural and,884.76,3.72
actually if we crop in so just literally,886.8,4.08
pinch in on that one time shot you can,888.48,3.719
see there is more detail and that's,890.88,3.66
thanks to the new 48 plus 12 megapixel,892.199,4.38
combined shot although on the face of it,894.54,5.84
you may be hard-pressed and noticed,896.579,3.801
now to answer the question of is the 15,901.44,4.74
Pro Max's Zoom better than the pros well,903.42,4.859
it comes down to what you want really so,906.18,4.74
between 1 and 2.9 times Zoom they're,908.279,5.401
basically the same between 3 and 4.9 the,910.92,5.46
pro wins but then 5 to 25 times the,913.68,4.5
Promax wins makes sense given the,916.38,3.6
hardware and of course in an Ideal World,918.18,3.659
we'd see the pro Max with four lenses,919.98,4.14
like the s23 ultra so there isn't a,921.839,3.481
compromise,924.12,3.18
but the question is do you prefer a,925.32,3.6
three times portrait or a five times,927.3,4.979
portrait 84 millimeters or 120. you can,928.92,5.039
obviously shoot both on both phones,932.279,2.821
although the quality isn't going to be,933.959,2.401
the same and the real world difference,935.1,2.82
with the pro Max is that you just have,936.36,5.039
to take two or three steps back,937.92,5.82
what you can now do as my cameraman,941.399,4.081
James is demonstrating is Jump between,943.74,3.899
all the different lenses while shooting,945.48,4.5
at 4K 60. previously you couldn't go to,947.639,4.32
ultra Wide Auto photo depending on which,949.98,3.78
one you started with but now at the,951.959,3.421
highest resolution and frame rate you,953.76,3.06
can switch between them all and I'm kind,955.38,3.24
of curious how it looks going between,956.82,3.959
those lenses just darting in and out,958.62,3.779
obviously I can't see but hopefully,960.779,3.3
you'll let me know in the comments what,962.399,2.701
do you think how's that five times,964.079,2.521
stability,965.1,3.12
although I had hoped they'd have made,966.6,2.94
some changes and upgrades to the,968.22,3.96
Cinematic Mode still stuck to 4K 30 no,969.54,4.68
prores or log options it still looks,972.18,3.54
pretty good particularly in nice,974.22,3.96
lighting but there is no kind of new,975.72,4.919
next-gen mode of cinematic where if you,978.18,4.14
shoot regular video you can then add,980.639,4.681
depth stuff afterwards maybe next year,982.32,4.68
I'm also pleased to see that they have,985.32,3.72
slightly reduced the lens flare it's,987.0,3.48
definitely still there and we get those,989.04,3.419
sort of light floaters as I call them,990.48,3.479
but in this particular shot you can no,992.459,4.081
longer see the camera lens outline,993.959,4.201
but what do you think of this new camera,996.54,3.539
system would it tempt you to upgrade,998.16,4.799
another upgrade is actually the price,1000.079,5.161
it's now cheaper or at least here in the,1002.959,4.261
UK Apple always set their prices by US,1005.24,3.3
Dollars first and then look at other,1007.22,3.299
currencies and adjust for inflation and,1008.54,4.56
tax and things but the iPhone 15 the,1010.519,4.44
regular one is actually 50 pounds,1013.1,4.02
cheaper now in the UK starting at 799,1014.959,5.281
down from 849 the 15 Pro is 100 quid,1017.12,5.459
cheaper it's now starting at 999 rather,1020.24,4.98
than 1099 and the 15 Pro Max is actually,1022.579,6.181
the same price 11.99 but now with 256,1025.22,5.76
gigs of storage anyway let's wrap up,1028.76,4.26
this review should you buy a 15 pro and,1030.98,4.199
pro Max well it all depends if you do an,1033.02,4.08
upgrade how old is your current phone I,1035.179,3.721
reckon anyone with an iPhone 11 or older,1037.1,4.199
yes go for it in terms of the Pro versus,1038.9,4.86
the pro Max for me it comes down to the,1041.299,4.201
bigger battery that's why I want this,1043.76,3.419
guy and also I prefer the bigger screen,1045.5,2.819
which is actually now a lot more,1047.179,2.88
comfortable to use because of the sort,1048.319,3.781
of smaller form factor but I reckon even,1050.059,4.081
if as a package it's not that,1052.1,3.959
significantly different from 14 pro Max,1054.14,3.899
the there are lots of nice incremental,1056.059,4.261
upgrades and as I say with the pro GPU,1058.039,4.741
with USBC this is kind of like the new,1060.32,4.62
Baseline for iPhones if you buy anything,1062.78,4.98
older without USBC you can restricted to,1064.94,4.8
last gen stuff but what do you reckon,1067.76,3.419
are you tempted to upgrade have you,1069.74,2.819
already ordered one let me know what you,1071.179,2.88
make of the new 15 Pros in the comments,1072.559,2.581
below thank you so much for watching,1074.059,2.521
guys and I'll see you next time right,1075.14,4.7
here on the tech chat,1076.58,3.26
okay Apple's iPhone 15s we're looking at,1.56,3.84
all four devices here we have the iPhone,3.899,4.921
15 the 15 plus the 15 Pro and the 15 Pro,5.4,5.52
Max uh having spent a few days with,8.82,3.72
these devices there's so much more to,10.92,2.82
talk about than I'd originally thought,12.54,4.319
let's start off here with the 15 and the,13.74,5.34
15 plus so both of these devices have an,16.859,3.84
aluminum build still they're roughly the,19.08,3.359
same size and shape as the previous,20.699,3.301
generation the biggest difference,22.439,3.481
aesthetically is going to be the rounded,24.0,3.539
edges now if you look at Apple's,25.92,3.3
marketing material they do such a good,27.539,3.301
job selling it right it makes it look,29.22,3.72
like they've created some aluminum,30.84,4.2
pillow for your hand it looks so smooth,32.94,4.32
and soft in the imagery it does look,35.04,3.96
really good apple did a fantastic job,37.26,4.68
making these new iPhones look just,39.0,4.68
distinctly iPhone this is the new,41.94,3.9
rounded Edge design and they have that,43.68,3.539
design language right now no one else is,45.84,2.879
doing it and the same thing goes with,47.219,2.941
the pro devices these have the same,48.719,3.84
rounded edges as the non-pro and they,50.16,5.219
just look so cool I feel like the design,52.559,5.16
language on this is nice especially with,55.379,4.081
that nice titanium color but the moment,57.719,3.66
you case it the design language is kind,59.46,4.38
of lost now in terms of materials the,61.379,4.74
iPhone 15 and 15 plus have that aluminum,63.84,4.2
rail on the side but they also have a,66.119,3.961
new satin finish gloss back and during,68.04,3.36
the presentation they're like this is,70.08,3.48
some color infused glass material and I,71.4,3.24
was like what's so special about that,73.56,3.72
but I realized this isn't just regular,74.64,5.04
glass this is I mean it's a derivative,77.28,5.22
gorilla glass right so colored Gorilla,79.68,5.28
Glass is very uncommon and I thought why,82.5,3.78
would they even do this like what is,84.96,2.519
what was wrong with the previous,86.28,3.36
iteration of the iPhone right so this is,87.479,5.041
the iPhone 14 and it's just a glass back,89.64,4.32
and the way that they color it is they,92.52,3.54
just add a colored layer on the bottom,93.96,3.839
of it and then just the color goes,96.06,3.9
through that see-through glass right why,97.799,5.82
not just run this and I honestly the,99.96,5.1
only thing I can think of like the only,103.619,3.241
thing that thinks like okay maybe this,105.06,3.48
is why it's that if you have colored,106.86,4.799
glass you get to vary the kind of,108.54,4.68
intensity of the color based on the,111.659,3.24
thickness of the glass so on this,113.22,3.24
portion of it where there's like a thin,114.899,2.941
layer of glass,116.46,3.6
it's like a faint pink but then when you,117.84,4.38
have it on the camera hump so it's a,120.06,3.9
thicker layer of glass it's just a more,122.22,3.78
intense color because there's just more,123.96,3.839
of those color particles in it and it's,126.0,3.539
kind of neat but I'm like,127.799,3.901
I don't know it seems it seems a little,129.539,3.601
strange that they focus on this thing,131.7,3.119
but I guess that's what they're going,133.14,3.959
for now the colors are really pale when,134.819,3.301
I started the event I was like those,137.099,3.541
look pretty muted but in person the blue,138.12,4.86
looks like it's like this it almost,140.64,4.2
looks white right almost looks like a,142.98,4.08
very cool looking white color but all,144.84,4.2
the colors this year are almost pastel,147.06,4.38
the pro devices have a titanium Rail and,149.04,3.6
these look really nice to me so they,151.44,3.299
have like a brushed finish to them it's,152.64,3.36
very subtle you kind of have to put it,154.739,3.241
like right up to the camera to see but I,156.0,3.9
think it looks really cool I will say,157.98,3.42
that the fingerprints on the natural,159.9,3.479
color don't show up very readily like,161.4,4.02
it's very good at hiding fingerprints,163.379,5.22
but the black device uh this shows up,165.42,5.16
more ready like this yeah you can see it,168.599,3.36
right here like you can just see the,170.58,3.18
kind of greasy smudges on it also I've,171.959,3.481
noticed that sometimes like the buttons,173.76,3.54
of the area around the buttons it just,175.44,3.96
kind of builds up kind of like smudgy,177.3,3.96
stuff but these are just little details,179.4,3.119
I only bring this up because I feel like,181.26,3.119
because this is the flagship device and,182.519,4.021
the flagship material some people just,184.379,4.321
really care and I thought I'd just share,186.54,3.6
my quick experiences with it but I do,188.7,3.78
think that this like the natural,190.14,5.099
titanium man this is such a nice looking,192.48,4.679
color like everything about this metal,195.239,4.201
just Vibes with me I mean look at me I,197.159,4.141
have a gray set like I love everything,199.44,4.5
gray you my watch is great right when,201.3,4.14
was the last time you saw an all gray,203.94,3.36
phone they're not common the last one I,205.44,3.24
had I think was like the Samsung Galaxy,207.3,3.96
S9 uh okay in terms of its weight so,208.68,6.779
this with its titanium rail is a lighter,211.26,5.52
phone than the previous generation like,215.459,3.721
the iPhone 14 pro now one thing to keep,216.78,3.84
in mind is that even though the weight,219.18,2.94
difference isn't substantial like,220.62,3.36
numerically I think because of the,222.12,4.5
distribution of weight this is it's just,223.98,5.0
a different feeling kind of phone so,226.62,4.74
this is like if you think about the,228.98,3.759
weight distribution on this thing this,231.36,3.48
now has an aluminum plate and because,232.739,3.601
it's got that aluminum plate with the,234.84,3.0
titanium frame I think the weight is,236.34,3.179
distributed more evenly across the whole,237.84,4.619
device on the iPhone 14 pro this didn't,239.519,4.741
have an aluminum plate and there was,242.459,3.661
also a heavier steel frame that wrapped,244.26,3.42
around the perimeter of this device but,246.12,4.199
when compared to the 15 Pro Max this,247.68,4.74
device is just the weight distribution,250.319,5.28
makes this device feel a lot lighter,252.42,4.439
than like you know the eight or nine,255.599,2.521
percent weight reduction that it has,256.859,3.66
it's only single digit in terms of like,258.12,3.78
the absolute number but it definitely,260.519,3.061
feels more,261.9,3.6
I want to use the word agile but what,263.58,4.32
are we talking about like agile phones,265.5,4.38
what I'm trying to make is,267.9,5.04
that this device has it feels a lot,269.88,5.039
lighter than just that that what the,272.94,3.3
numbers would seem to indicate right,274.919,2.641
eight or nine percent doesn't seem that,276.24,2.94
much but it feels a lot lighter and,277.56,3.0
feels good okay I want to move over to,279.18,4.26
the cases so Apple's iPhone cases the,280.56,5.04
ones that are available in the store uh,283.44,4.38
there's like your classic silicone which,285.6,4.2
I'm going to put onto this one,287.82,4.319
just to demonstrate real quick but they,289.8,4.98
also have in their kind of environmental,292.139,5.881
efforts gone rid of the leather cases so,294.78,6.479
this is the fine woven material and it's,298.02,5.7
sitting on top of a pro Max here so the,301.259,4.38
15 Pro Max but,303.72,4.8
I have concerns about this material,305.639,4.201
actually let's talk about the silicone,308.52,3.84
this feels awesome right I feel like I'm,309.84,4.38
a huge fan of silicone and I don't think,312.36,3.6
that the shape of this case has changed,314.22,3.72
much despite the new rounded edges but,315.96,4.2
this fine woven material,317.94,5.28
this stuff for one it scuffs very easily,320.16,4.44
so I'm just going to demonstrate really,323.22,2.699
quick I'm just take my fingernail don't,324.6,3.42
have super long fingernails right I I,325.919,4.62
mark it uh and it's there and it doesn't,328.02,5.459
go away like this is their pretty much,330.539,5.1
permanently uh and if I did it a bunch,333.479,5.22
of times it would just scuff and unlike,335.639,4.921
leather like leather scratches quite,338.699,3.361
easily as well but that kind of patina,340.56,3.359
is nicely it's got this kind of worn,342.06,4.88
leather look to it it's a look,343.919,6.72
worn like cloth I don't know it doesn't,346.94,6.699
it's not a look to me also this doesn't,350.639,5.34
feel particularly premium I understand,353.639,4.741
it's recycled material but this feels,355.979,5.16
like almost like a cheap polyester kind,358.38,4.5
of like bed sheeting it's strange and,361.139,4.461
it's got that like,362.88,2.72
it's not my favorite material and the,366.419,3.481
fabric is quite thin if you compare this,368.16,3.9
case to like the pixel 5 case this is,369.9,3.96
obviously a dated case quite a few years,372.06,3.96
back but this looked and felt like a,373.86,5.22
very substantial weave case right this,376.02,4.26
is like,379.08,3.3
maybe they had to keep it thin for the,380.28,3.479
magnets like I just I'm just thinking,382.38,2.939
maybe because of magsafe they need the,383.759,3.421
magnets to be a particular strength they,385.319,3.541
got to keep this material really thin so,387.18,3.9
the accessories stick to it I don't know,388.86,4.32
but it just ain't my speed uh there is a,391.08,3.899
clear case a new clear case from dbrand,393.18,3.72
this is called their ghost case so you,394.979,4.881
can see through it and you can see the,396.9,5.28
language the design language and the,399.86,4.66
materials of the new phones which is,402.18,3.959
kind of cool uh I want to talk about the,404.52,4.019
action button so on the iPhone 15 and 15,406.139,4.56
plus it still has that standard mute,408.539,4.081
switch we've seen this for well over a,410.699,4.081
decade on the iPhone uh and it's just,412.62,3.78
like your standard,414.78,5.58
switch to turn notifications on and off,416.4,7.44
but the new iPhone 15 Pros have an,420.36,4.8
action button and this is a button,423.84,3.299
that's a customizable input and it's the,425.16,3.78
first kind of customizable button we've,427.139,3.361
ever had on an iPhone which is kind of,428.94,3.36
cool but does take some time to get used,430.5,3.6
to because we're so used to just mute,432.3,3.959
switches from literally over a decade of,434.1,4.319
using stuff like that they software,436.259,4.081
control for muting the phone now is a,438.419,3.18
little bit different but in terms of,440.34,2.52
what you can do with the action button,441.599,2.88
there's a whole bunch of things like uh,442.86,3.3
like you can put different Focus modes,444.479,3.12
you have your camera launcher you can,446.16,3.479
launch a flashlight voice memos,447.599,4.801
shortcuts I've personally set it to the,449.639,5.161
camera and for me it's just like any,452.4,4.44
time I've ever had any kind of like,454.8,4.2
winter sports I'm just you can't launch,456.84,3.54
the camera without taking off your,459.0,3.479
gloves and like launching the phone or,460.38,3.78
you have to have like touch sensitive,462.479,3.541
gloves that can like you're like poking,464.16,3.42
your screen to be able to long press a,466.02,3.48
button to launch a camera,467.58,4.44
so much easier it's so Android a lack of,469.5,4.44
a better term but I like it and I think,472.02,3.299
most people will as well just take some,473.94,2.819
time to get used to it now I do wish,475.319,3.061
there was some kind of tactile marking,476.759,3.0
on it so you could feel for it in your,478.38,2.819
pocket to know that this was the thing,479.759,3.241
that you were long pressing to do your,481.199,3.241
action all right let's talk about the,483.0,3.78
display so the iPhone 15 and 15 plus,484.44,4.14
have significantly improved displays,486.78,3.66
compared to the previous generation I,488.58,3.119
think they changed them in ways that,490.44,3.96
just I wouldn't have expected so these,491.699,4.681
now both have bigger screens than the,494.4,4.44
iPhone 14 and 14 plus from last year,496.38,5.58
these have the same screen size and,498.84,5.34
resolution as the Pro Models these have,501.96,3.78
the same brightness the same Peak,504.18,3.419
brightness the same Dynamic Island up,505.74,3.6
top it's got the same HDR capabilities,507.599,4.201
it's really weird how close they are in,509.34,4.619
terms of the overall screen I'm most,511.8,4.14
surprised by the 2000 nits in Peak,513.959,3.541
brightness it's just for legibility when,515.94,2.519
you're Outdoors but that's something,517.5,2.64
that companies usually reserve for like,518.459,3.781
their Flagship stuff but the non-pro,520.14,3.66
models are still missing two features,522.24,2.7
first it doesn't have an always-on,523.8,3.06
display if that matters to you but the,524.94,3.48
second thing is that this is still,526.86,4.8
running a 60hz display on the non-pro,528.42,5.28
amateur model and I really think they,531.66,3.239
use it to distinguish the difference,533.7,3.12
between like the pros and the amateurs,534.899,2.94
because,536.82,2.94
I don't think that the cost of,537.839,3.961
production is that far apart at this,539.76,3.66
point at least not for Apple because the,541.8,3.84
volumes are so high but when I review,543.42,3.72
these phones and you see them side by,545.64,4.379
side the 60 hertz just it's got the,547.14,4.92
stutter right but I really think if I,550.019,3.841
remove myself from this situation I try,552.06,3.839
to like not be a sweaty tech nerd about,553.86,4.68
it I really think like 99 of the world,555.899,4.261
doesn't care about it I've shown it to,558.54,3.06
many of my friends and my family members,560.16,3.179
I was like yeah that's cool that,561.6,3.48
promotion is neat and all but like who,563.339,5.281
cares uh and in that line it's like very,565.08,5.58
very little media takes advantage of,568.62,3.42
that stuff very few games takes,570.66,3.239
advantage of 120 hertz but it's mostly,572.04,4.62
just the UI right when you're in the UI,573.899,3.961
and you're browsing on your phone you're,576.66,4.44
doing stuff having promotion,577.86,6.479
is just so much nicer to look at if your,581.1,4.799
eyes are used to it and the fact that,584.339,3.361
they don't have it is just ridiculous,585.899,3.06
because there are phones out there that,587.7,3.54
are like 300 bucks that have 120hz,588.959,4.5
displays for it to be missing on a 700,591.24,4.86
phone it hurts and in terms of the,593.459,6.661
bezels on the uh regular iPhone 15 the,596.1,5.34
bezels are a little bit thinner compared,600.12,2.76
to last year these are more aligned with,601.44,3.36
like the 14 pro models from last year,602.88,5.1
but the 15 Pro Models they're very thin,604.8,6.479
the bezels I will say I this is just,607.98,6.0
anecdotal story here when I'm playing,611.279,5.041
games sometimes the meat of my hand,613.98,3.78
would be touching the screen and because,616.32,3.24
the bezels are so thin it would,617.76,3.6
interfere with the button inputs of my,619.56,3.959
fingers it was uncommon but it did,621.36,5.46
happen a few times on the 15 Pro also I,623.519,5.101
think the front glass on all the new,626.82,3.9
devices is actually slightly curved at,628.62,3.36
the edges if you run your finger against,630.72,3.239
it you can feel it so screen protectors,631.98,3.78
might not easily cover that full front,633.959,4.44
screen and in terms of the ports so,635.76,5.36
thanks to the EU we have,638.399,4.861
USBC ports baby,641.12,4.779
we've always wanted this I'm still in,643.26,3.96
disbelief that this is like something,645.899,4.221
I'm staring at USBC ports on an iPhone,647.22,6.42
uh so the regular iPhone has USB 2,650.12,4.54
speeds,653.64,4.319
uh pro model has USB 3 speeds there's no,654.66,5.34
like malicious intent here I see a lot,657.959,3.541
of the comments are like oh my gosh why,660.0,3.839
does the you know the regular iPhone 15,661.5,4.44
still have usb2 I think it's just the,663.839,4.921
chip this chip that's in here the the,665.94,5.76
a16 bionic it was never meant to have,668.76,5.04
USB 3 speeds it was just not a thing,671.7,5.04
when that chip was developed and that's,673.8,5.82
the chip that's in here so no USB 3. now,676.74,4.8
if you do frequently dump massive files,679.62,3.779
from your phone onto your laptop and you,681.54,3.239
do need that speed you got to go for,683.399,4.261
that iPhone 15 Pro but you also need a,684.779,4.381
new cable because the one that comes in,687.66,4.2
the box is this thing here so this is a,689.16,5.04
very nice looking braided cable double,691.86,5.88
ended USBC however this is USB 2.0,694.2,6.3
I see my Twitter light up with people,697.74,4.74
who are very angry about this,700.5,4.019
it's very normal like I can't think of,702.48,3.96
any phone company or a laptop company,704.519,4.32
even that does include a USB 3 cable for,706.44,5.399
charging it's invariably like USB 2.0,708.839,4.381
that's the industry standard when it,711.839,4.321
comes to charging cables for charging uh,713.22,4.679
okay the other things you can plug up to,716.16,3.66
that hole basically anything with a USB,717.899,3.901
connection you can plug up keyboards and,719.82,4.259
monitors you get like 4K 60 DisplayPort,721.8,4.08
out and you can charge your iPods you,724.079,3.361
can charge the old ones with lightning,725.88,3.6
cable and the new ones with the USBC,727.44,3.959
cable because the new one has a USBC,729.48,4.2
Port now in terms of performance the a17,731.399,4.62
chip is faster like you would expect and,733.68,4.8
it can sustain a full workload a little,736.019,4.201
bit longer than the previous generations,738.48,4.38
of the iPhone Pros but it's nothing,740.22,4.32
crazy like I don't think at this point,742.86,3.3
people are using their phone to me like,744.54,3.9
man if only this phone was faster right,746.16,4.2
that's just really not a thing I will,748.44,3.899
say that the GPU has seen like the,750.36,4.2
biggest jump this year uh they did,752.339,3.901
showcase some games I was able to test,754.56,3.6
out an early build of Resident Evil,756.24,4.62
Village this looks very good for a phone,758.16,4.26
it's a really demanding game I remember,760.86,4.08
benchmarking this thing on like RTX 3080,762.42,4.74
laptops even last year and to see it,764.94,4.199
running on a phone with all the original,767.16,4.26
assets at a consistent 30 frames per,769.139,4.861
second is very cool it feels like the,771.42,4.62
GPU capabilities on this phone is,774.0,4.38
similar to like a PS4 like an Xbox one,776.04,5.099
it's it's very impressive considering,778.38,4.259
the size of it but it's like in case,781.139,3.121
people are wondering like is it like a,782.639,4.32
PlayStation 5 it's not but considering,784.26,4.68
the size of the device very impressive,786.959,4.021
now in terms of battery life so I ran,788.94,3.899
the same battery testing that I did,790.98,4.74
three years in a row now and I didn't,792.839,4.56
see much of a change in terms of like,795.72,3.6
the overall battery life of the phone,797.399,4.081
but what I did notice was a big spike up,799.32,5.1
in the gaming battery life so Pokemon,801.48,5.22
unite isn't a very demanding game but it,804.42,4.5
does just suck up juice and I ran this,806.7,3.78
test a couple times it's a lot better,808.92,3.599
this year I think it's just the GPU on,810.48,4.2
the a17 pro a lot more efficient okay,812.519,3.661
I'm gonna wrap up with a conversation,814.68,2.82
about the camera but I'm going to steer,816.18,4.26
this conversation to just how I use the,817.5,4.139
camera like the stuff that I find,820.44,3.0
interesting or important about the,821.639,4.561
camera so all four of the new iPhone 15s,823.44,4.92
this year have a 48 megapixel main,826.2,4.439
sensors both the regular devices and the,828.36,4.14
pro devices the sensor on the pro,830.639,3.121
devices are going to be bigger and,832.5,3.779
better but still 48 megapixels and they,833.76,5.579
also shoot with 24 megapixel files so if,836.279,5.281
you took like the original 12 megapixel,839.339,4.921
file from yesteryear and you added 50,841.56,5.399
more pickles pickles pixels going up and,844.26,5.16
then 50 more pixels going wide that,846.959,4.44
would be the new shot so it's about 50,849.42,4.62
bigger in terms of file size I would say,851.399,6.421
on the regular iPhone 15s the shots in,854.04,7.5
24 megapixels are more detailed slightly,857.82,5.459
but I just don't think worth that,861.54,5.099
exercise uh the extra 50 size is like it,863.279,4.8
fills up your phone faster it's harder,866.639,2.76
to work with you're sending out more,868.079,3.421
data if you're sharing photos it's just,869.399,4.141
it's a lot and I don't feel like the,871.5,5.519
sensor on the regular iPhone 15s really,873.54,5.4
makes good use of that extra resolution,877.019,5.221
but on the pro I would say it is worth,878.94,5.639
it uh they just the detail is there I,882.24,4.08
think it's absolutely worth that larger,884.579,3.961
file size so if it were me my decision,886.32,4.139
if I had either one of the regular,888.54,3.479
phones I would just set it to the 12,890.459,4.62
megapixel shot and just save that file,892.019,5.221
space and then if I had on the pro I,895.079,4.081
mean the 12 megapixel shots still look,897.24,3.24
better anyways but if you want that,899.16,3.179
extra resolution and you don't mind the,900.48,4.32
larger files it can take advantage of it,902.339,4.321
now in terms of low light photography,904.8,4.68
it's still not great I mean Apple talked,906.66,4.14
a little bit about how they improved it,909.48,3.479
but the pixel 7 devices and Samsung's,910.8,5.039
s23 devices look better to me Apple also,912.959,4.201
talks about how they addressed some of,915.839,2.761
the lens flare that has been in some of,917.16,3.179
their photography so sometimes you'll,918.6,3.539
see some reflective orbs floating around,920.339,3.841
some of your shots uh they're definitely,922.139,4.38
less pronounced on the iPhone 15 cameras,924.18,3.779
but they're still visible here and there,926.519,3.241
and it's particularly noticeable still,927.959,4.261
in night shots with bright lights now in,929.76,4.019
terms of the multiple focal lengths that,932.22,3.179
they have for the main sensor I can,933.779,4.68
shoot like 24 28 and 35 millimeter when,935.399,4.74
I first saw the presentation I was like,938.459,3.661
that's kind of neat but isn't it just,940.139,4.38
like crops like it seems like it was,942.12,4.8
just cropping in on that main sensor it,944.519,4.081
turns out there's a lot more to it so,946.92,4.919
there is a very interesting technical,948.6,4.739
method as to how they do it like so,951.839,3.481
they're capturing light data from,953.339,4.081
multiple lenses and then fusing it,955.32,4.68
together to create the image it's very,957.42,4.979
cool in terms of how it's done but in,960.0,4.8
terms of how I use my camera like I,962.399,3.841
don't feel like I've ever taken a shot,964.8,3.96
and switched I wanted to even you know,966.24,5.219
the difference between a 24 and a 28,968.76,4.74
millimeter is very small at least for,971.459,3.961
the stuff that I shoot and then even at,973.5,4.62
35 not that useful for my personal,975.42,5.039
photography okay but the thing that I,978.12,5.04
thought was the coolest thing by far is,980.459,4.38
the automatic portrait mode and I,983.16,3.359
actually think that this is going to be,984.839,4.381
copied by other phone companies it's the,986.519,4.44
ability to just basically take a shot,989.22,3.96
not think about it and the phone will,990.959,4.141
capture the depth data so you can adjust,993.18,4.98
the focus later and to not think about,995.1,4.679
it like to just not have to press,998.16,3.359
portrait mode and just and just does it,999.779,4.081
automatically is super cool so if it,1001.519,5.041
detects a face or like a human face or A,1003.86,5.039
Pet's face it can supposedly do it I did,1006.56,4.019
notice that it only works for like large,1008.899,3.541
pets like my kid has a goldfish it,1010.579,3.301
didn't work for that but if you have,1012.44,4.38
just regular large faces it works and it,1013.88,4.86
works really well and just the ability,1016.82,4.8
to adjust this stuff in post but not,1018.74,4.5
think about it when you take the shot is,1021.62,4.319
so useful like it's just a nice looking,1023.24,4.26
shot but you do need to keep in mind,1025.939,3.12
that that original shot that you take,1027.5,3.54
has to be in Focus like if it wasn't in,1029.059,4.561
Focus that it won't be able to fix it uh,1031.04,4.56
using this portrait mode stuff uh okay,1033.62,4.799
last thing the zoom so I'm sure you're,1035.6,6.719
aware by now the iPhone Pro Max iPhone,1038.419,7.081
15 Pro Max has a zoom lens and this,1042.319,6.901
thing is a 5x optimal actually you can,1045.5,5.1
see the difference between so this,1049.22,3.9
device here is the regular other 15 Pro,1050.6,5.28
and you can see the lens right there and,1053.12,5.6
the 15 Pro Max has a much larger,1055.88,5.82
aperture for that zoom lens a couple,1058.72,4.959
thoughts I don't think that the 5x,1061.7,4.219
telephoto is particularly powerful,1063.679,6.12
Samsung has 10x opticals that just are,1065.919,6.101
twice as powerful I think that it's good,1069.799,3.721
that they're back they're more,1072.02,2.76
competitive in terms of the Zoom game,1073.52,3.18
they've been comically behind for years,1074.78,5.88
I would say the pixels 7 Pro their 5x,1076.7,5.46
Zoom is,1080.66,3.96
arguably better in terms of like,1082.16,4.56
sharpness and detail that's able to,1084.62,4.799
capture at that 5x but the fact that the,1086.72,5.94
iPhone has a 5x Zoom is great now I,1089.419,4.681
think the one conversation that might,1092.66,4.68
come up is like should you get the pro,1094.1,7.079
or the sort of the pro Max or the pro,1097.34,5.82
because when you go with the pro Max,1101.179,4.981
your Zoom range is like you start at 5x,1103.16,6.18
and anything underneath 5x is not an,1106.16,5.16
optical zoom it's like cropped sensors,1109.34,3.9
and on this device because it has the 3x,1111.32,4.38
Zoom like the original older style 3x,1113.24,4.98
Zoom you do have that kind of mid-range,1115.7,5.28
telephoto covered a little bit better my,1118.22,4.62
take on it is that,1120.98,3.96
it doesn't matter it really doesn't,1122.84,3.839
matter if I mean if you're getting,1124.94,3.479
sweaty over this because you're like a,1126.679,3.061
professional photographer that's a whole,1128.419,2.281
separate question but if you're just,1129.74,2.28
someone who wants to buy a phone and you,1130.7,2.52
want to take photos like normal human,1132.02,2.399
beings with your family and friends and,1133.22,3.18
just things that you do in your life,1134.419,5.221
don't buy the phone based on its zoom,1136.4,5.7
capabilities buy it for everything else,1139.64,4.919
that's just my take on it okay pricing,1142.1,5.34
the base models start at 800 the pro,1144.559,4.801
model started a thousand but I found,1147.44,3.359
that chart again where someone on Reddit,1149.36,4.14
had graphed out or charted out the,1150.799,4.441
percentage of yearly income that it,1153.5,3.059
would take for someone to purchase one,1155.24,3.78
of these base model iPhone 15s it spread,1156.559,3.901
across a lot of different countries but,1159.02,3.3
at the top of the list was Myanmar,1160.46,3.24
that's the country my grandmother was,1162.32,3.42
from and it's just crazy to see how,1163.7,3.9
expensive this phone can be for a lot of,1165.74,2.88
people in this world I think it's,1167.6,2.4
something we should keep in mind when we,1168.62,3.6
look at the prices of these iPhones okay,1170.0,6.26
there you have it the iPhone 15.,1172.22,4.04
the first titanium build on an iPhone a,0.0,5.339
new action button improved cameras and,2.82,6.0
USB type-c finally this is the new,5.339,6.361
iPhone 15 pro and pro Max one of the,8.82,4.739
First videos with these in the wall so a,11.7,2.939
thumbs up for your boy would be,13.559,3.001
appreciated I've had these for about,14.639,3.9
three days now and I have some early,16.56,4.26
thoughts but first let's get them,18.539,4.921
unboxed so I have the blue titanium for,20.82,4.86
the iPhone 15 Pro and the natural,23.46,5.34
titanium for the pro Max these were the,25.68,5.759
most popular choices we do have a black,28.8,4.74
and white titanium available too and,31.439,4.14
inside the boxes as well as the devices,33.54,5.94
we do get a braided USB type-c to USB,35.579,6.061
type-c cable I am glad that this is,39.48,4.079
braided there's a little pack with a SIM,41.64,4.68
card tool warranty info and a white,43.559,5.401
Apple sticker now keep in mind that if,46.32,4.38
you are based in the US you may not get,48.96,4.14
a sim tool because it is easy Sim only,50.7,5.1
here in the UK we still do get a SIM,53.1,5.479
card tray,55.8,2.779
and here they are now the blue titanium,60.84,6.3
does remind me a lot of the iPhone 12,64.44,5.219
Pro blue but the natural titanium is,67.14,4.32
quite unique I don't think we've had a,69.659,3.841
color like this on an iPhone before and,71.46,3.839
maybe that's the reason why it's been so,73.5,3.9
popular so we do have a ceramic Shield,75.299,4.68
to front with textured matte glass on,77.4,5.759
the back but the new thing is the frames,79.979,6.241
so we do have a titanium frame this is,83.159,5.161
the same titanium that's used on the,86.22,4.14
Mars rover not the exact same one,88.32,3.479
because the Mazda River would come back,90.36,3.48
and be very expensive but anyway I think,91.799,3.301
the most noticeable thing about the,93.84,3.48
iPhone 15 Pros is that they are actually,95.1,4.559
lighter compared to the 14 pro and pro,97.32,4.86
Max now this is because titanium is a,99.659,4.14
lighter metal compared to stainless,102.18,4.2
steel but it's still as durable and if,103.799,5.101
we bring the iPhone 14 pro Max here for,106.38,4.08
a side-by-side comparison with the,108.9,4.74
iPhone 15 Pro Max the 15 Pro Max is,110.46,4.979
noticed to be lighter it's around 20,113.64,4.019
grams lighter and this is definitely a,115.439,4.621
welcome change because the iPhone 14 pro,117.659,4.5
Max is a big big boy now another change,120.06,4.739
that we have are the contoured edges so,122.159,5.581
the iPhone 15 Pro Max just feels a,124.799,4.261
little bit more comfortable it's not as,127.74,3.6
sharp on the sides as the iPhone 14 pro,129.06,5.16
Max is because the 15 Pro does have a,131.34,4.86
brush Metal finish on the sides I would,134.22,3.599
say it's got a little bit more grip,136.2,3.84
compared to the stainless steel on a D14,137.819,4.381
a pro Max now one thing that I've not,140.04,5.04
liked about the iPhone 14 pro Max is the,142.2,4.619
fact that the glossy stainless steel,145.08,4.44
frame does attract lots of fingerprints,146.819,5.161
and can look very muggy with the iPhone,149.52,5.52
15 Pro Max fingerprints will be reduced,151.98,4.619
because of that matte finish but they,155.04,3.54
are not completely gone you'll still,156.599,4.14
notice them but they're just not as much,158.58,4.379
as the iPhone 14 pro Max now another,160.739,3.601
change we definitely have to talk about,162.959,2.64
is something that you won't be able to,164.34,3.66
see on the outside and that is the new,165.599,4.681
internal chassis structure which makes,168.0,5.519
the back more repairable now you may or,170.28,5.88
may not know that with the iPhone 14 pro,173.519,4.981
max if you want to smash the back of it,176.16,4.74
if you don't have Apple Care it can cost,178.5,5.519
up to 550 dollars to replace so that's,180.9,5.339
like half the price of the phone with,184.019,4.621
the iPhone 15 Pro Max it's gonna cost,186.239,5.041
around 200 so that's a significant,188.64,5.099
reduction now yes it should have been,191.28,4.8
the case from the start I mean replacing,193.739,4.201
the back of a smartphone costs saying,196.08,4.019
half the price of the smartphone is,197.94,4.439
really not good so I'm glad this is here,200.099,3.541
but yes it should have been there before,202.379,3.841
apart from that the iPhone 15 pro and,203.64,4.8
pro Max are very similar in size to the,206.22,4.799
iPhone 14 pro and pro Max they are smart,208.44,5.04
slightly thicker but they are slightly,211.019,3.661
smaller in terms of the height and,213.48,3.96
weight and that is because of the slight,214.68,5.22
Improvement in the smaller bezels on the,217.44,4.2
displays now you'll probably only be,219.9,3.899
able to notice these smaller bezels if,221.64,4.739
you do bring them side by side yes the,223.799,4.561
bezels are noticeably thinner but I,226.379,4.08
wouldn't say it's something significant,228.36,3.54
and something that you're going to be,230.459,3.661
noticing if you are using either of,231.9,4.199
these in isolation apart from that the,234.12,4.08
displays do remain unchanged we have,236.099,5.881
super retina xdr 6.1 inches for the,238.2,6.899
iPhone 15 Pro 6.7 inches for the iPhone,241.98,6.72
15 Pro Max OLED technology with the pro,245.099,6.121
motion up to 120 hertz for a smooth,248.7,4.619
experience always on display something,251.22,4.079
that I really like to have glanceable,253.319,3.901
information right there on my screen,255.299,4.201
without having to pick it up up to 2 000,257.22,5.759
nits of peak outdoor brightness and we,259.5,6.12
have the dynamic Island now the dynamic,262.979,4.861
island is here to stay we've now also,265.62,4.68
got it on the iPhone 15 and 15 plus now,267.84,4.26
I really do like like the dynamic Island,270.3,3.66
I think it makes the iPhones look very,272.1,3.96
unique and I also really like the,273.96,4.019
different animations that you get as,276.06,3.6
well as the useful information let me,277.979,2.94
give you an example when I was catching,279.66,3.24
my flight to go to the Apple event on,280.919,4.5
United I actually had a countdown timer,282.9,4.859
for boarding right there in the dynamic,285.419,4.741
Island which was so useful just to have,287.759,4.38
that there at a glance now having said,290.16,4.979
that I did mention in my iPhone 14 pro,292.139,6.301
max review as an actionable item the,295.139,5.401
dynamic Island to me is something that I,298.44,4.86
do not use because it is the top most,300.54,5.099
part of the smartphone and the least,303.3,4.44
reachable but anyway let's now talk,305.639,4.921
about the cameras so as far as we can,307.74,4.56
tell the hardware for the selfie camera,310.56,4.38
remains unchanged 12 megapixels with an,312.3,5.04
F 1.9 aperture and for the rear facing,314.94,4.68
cameras so the ultra wide camera again,317.34,4.74
the hardware is relatively unchanged so,319.62,4.859
it's 12 megapixels with an F 2.2,322.08,4.22
aperture but we do have a new,324.479,4.021
anti-reflective coating we can still,326.3,4.119
take macro filters with the ultrawide,328.5,3.66
camera and for the private camera we,330.419,4.801
have 48 megapixels now this was a little,332.16,4.56
bit confusing because in the keynote,335.22,4.62
Apple said that the sensor size is,336.72,6.419
larger compared to the iPhone 15 not,339.84,6.359
compared to the iPhone 14 pro and pro,343.139,6.06
Max so that tells me that the actual,346.199,6.06
sensor and Camera Hardware is the same,349.199,6.0
as the iPhone 14 pro and pro Max here,352.259,5.22
for the primary cameras but because of,355.199,4.381
the new chip we do have some,357.479,4.321
improvements number one we can now,359.58,4.5
choose between multiple different focal,361.8,4.38
lengths with the primary camera so we,364.08,4.92
could already do 1X as well as 2x which,366.18,5.1
would be using the middle part of the,369.0,4.62
sensor to give you lossless Zoom but now,371.28,5.22
we can also get the equivalent of 28 and,373.62,4.919
35 millimeters so you've got some more,376.5,4.259
Focus lengths which are also lossless,378.539,5.041
now what's more interesting to me is the,380.759,5.461
fact that now automatically you'll be,383.58,6.36
shooting at 24 megapixels so Apple has,386.22,5.22
got a balance between between the,389.94,3.78
photonic engine as well as the,391.44,4.5
resolution to give you that sweet spot,393.72,5.099
at 24 megapixels for most of your photos,395.94,5.099
and that's going to mean sharper images,398.819,4.32
and so far in my experience I've been,401.039,4.981
very impressed images are very sharp,403.139,5.761
detailed with lots of dynamic range and,406.02,4.679
good color now when you are using,408.9,4.079
features like night mode then you will,410.699,4.381
be switched back to 12 megapixels,412.979,4.56
because you will have to combine as many,415.08,4.86
pixels as possible to bring in more,417.539,4.741
light but personally what I'm most,419.94,5.099
excited about are portraits so we've now,422.28,5.039
got next-gen portraits let me break this,425.039,4.081
down because I have been so impressed,427.319,3.841
with this so far so traditionally if you,429.12,3.84
wanted to take portrait photos with a,431.16,4.02
blurry background then you would have to,432.96,4.38
physically go into portrait mode and,435.18,4.859
then take the photos now with this mode,437.34,4.56
traditionally you would not have live,440.039,4.5
photos with the iPhone 15 prone Pro Max,441.9,5.46
you do get live photos with portrait,444.539,4.861
mode however what's more interesting is,447.36,4.619
that the portrait mode depth effects,449.4,5.88
will be stored whenever you take a,451.979,6.901
normal image of a person or a pet so,455.28,5.039
this means you're no longer going to,458.88,3.06
have to remember to go into portrait,460.319,3.72
mode you're no longer going to have to,461.94,4.319
spend extra seconds going to portrait,464.039,3.961
mode if you want to quickly capture a,466.259,3.121
moment you're going to be able to do,468.0,4.38
this then go in after the fact and then,469.38,6.9
change the depth amount but you'll also,472.38,6.719
now for the first time be able to shift,476.28,5.58
Focus as well so maybe you want to focus,479.099,5.461
on something else in that image this is,481.86,4.98
so so awesome because I always encourage,484.56,4.259
people to take photos in portrait mode,486.84,3.6
if somebody hands me their smartphone,488.819,3.6
I'll put it into portrait mode take a,490.44,3.3
photo and they'll be like wow how did,492.419,3.06
you take such a good image and that's,493.74,3.179
because it's portrait mode now you're,495.479,2.761
not going to have to remember to go into,496.919,3.241
portrait mode now you might be thinking,498.24,3.78
all right what about if I'm not taking,500.16,4.379
pictures of people or pets or something,502.02,4.44
like that well you simply just have to,504.539,4.921
tap so if you want that same effect on a,506.46,4.679
regular photo then you just have to you,509.46,4.019
have to focus and then it's gonna come,511.139,4.441
up with this little f sign at the side,513.479,3.961
and it's going to let you know that this,515.58,3.72
image will be a normal image if you want,517.44,4.2
it to but it will also store that depth,519.3,4.14
information so you can edit after the,521.64,4.74
fact so far honestly I absolutely love,523.44,5.64
this feature it is so so good but of,526.38,4.98
course guys I've been working on a super,529.08,4.439
SAS style camera comparison between the,531.36,5.28
iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy,533.519,5.521
s23 Ultra I've already taken hundreds of,536.64,5.04
images and videos that video will be,539.04,5.64
coming in the next day or so so be sure,541.68,5.219
to subscribe and hit that Bell icon make,544.68,4.56
sure you switch on all notifications so,546.899,4.981
you do not miss it right the third,549.24,4.86
camera the telephoto camera so on the,551.88,5.16
iPhone 15 Pro the hardware is the same,554.1,4.799
12 megapixels and it's going to give you,557.04,4.739
three times telephoto Zoom the iPhone 15,558.899,6.841
Pro Max exclusively gets a new 5x,561.779,6.421
telephoto camera which is using a new,565.74,4.68
Tetra prism design from Apple and it's,568.2,5.04
also a a 25 larger sensor for the,570.42,5.099
teleporter camera compared to that on,573.24,4.98
the iPhone 15 Pro now this is a big step,575.519,4.981
up on the zoom side and it can also go,578.22,5.1
up to 25 times which again I have been,580.5,5.339
comparing to the zoom King I would say,583.32,5.88
the Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra I can't,585.839,5.041
wait to share those results with you now,589.2,3.12
before we talk about video just to,590.88,3.42
quickly remind you guys the super sass,592.32,3.84
style sunglasses are finally back in,594.3,4.2
stock they feature the iconic black on,596.16,4.26
black design with the reflective,598.5,4.5
mirrored lenses but are now polarized to,600.42,4.859
reduce Reflections it literally lets you,603.0,4.08
see through glass when you are on a,605.279,3.841
sunny day out and the frames are also,607.08,4.62
made with acetates for durability and a,609.12,4.74
more premium look and feel they still,611.7,5.1
come with a premium case cloth and box,613.86,4.8
and as always a portion of profits will,616.8,3.719
be going to charitable causes now there,618.66,4.26
is just Limited stock available I'd,620.519,3.841
assume we're going to sell out in the,622.92,3.539
next few days or so so if you haven't,624.36,3.72
already and you want to get your hands,626.459,3.901
on the supersaf style sunglasses then,628.08,4.379
head over over to supersafstyle.com,630.36,3.419
we'll use the link down in the,632.459,3.361
description below and get them while you,633.779,3.841
can because I'm not sure when we're,635.82,4.019
going to get stuck again so for video 4K,637.62,4.44
60 frames a second with HDR and Dolby,639.839,5.341
Vision excellent quality so far I am a,642.06,4.98
huge fan of the video that the iPhones,645.18,4.32
take my favorite smartphones for taking,647.04,4.38
video now we will be getting spatial,649.5,3.06
videos so you're going to be able to,651.42,3.599
record 3D videos using two lenses that's,652.56,4.56
going to be coming later on next year,655.019,5.161
and that's mainly for use with the Apple,657.12,4.74
Vision Pro which is also going to be,660.18,3.779
coming next year now two new pro video,661.86,3.659
features we have on the pro and the pro,663.959,3.841
Max firstly log encoding so you're going,665.519,3.841
to be able to shoot in log and then,667.8,4.08
grade your footage later on we also now,669.36,5.34
have prores video recording 4K up to 60,671.88,5.579
frames a second with external recording,674.7,6.3
and that is thanks to the new USB type-c,677.459,6.0
port finally let's just talk about this,681.0,4.26
for a second because I've been ranting,683.459,4.261
about this for many many years it was so,685.26,4.62
frustrating to me that the new iPhone,687.72,4.559
still had light lightning lightning was,689.88,4.44
great when it initially came out 10 11,692.279,5.161
years ago but more recently even all of,694.32,5.28
my Apple products use USB type-c in my,697.44,4.74
MacBook Pro my iPad Pro my iPad mini but,699.6,4.739
as well as that all of my other tech,702.18,3.659
devices such as the camera that I'm,704.339,3.421
shooting this on my Android smartphones,705.839,4.5
all have USB type-c but I still had to,707.76,4.74
carry around a lightning cable whenever,710.339,3.841
I was traveling there were times when I,712.5,3.3
forgot it and I had to go ahead and buy,714.18,2.94
a new one which was super annoying but,715.8,4.08
now I can just have the one cable that,717.12,5.58
is going to be with me all the time yes,719.88,4.74
it should have been here a long time ago,722.7,3.72
but I'm just glad that it's finally here,724.62,3.18
it's still really weird to be able to,726.42,4.08
plug in USB type-c on the iPhone it's,727.8,4.02
going to take me some time to get used,730.5,3.72
to that now with the iPhone 15 pro and,731.82,6.18
pro Max they do support USB 3 speed so,734.22,6.239
that's up to 10 gigabits a second that's,738.0,4.44
around 20 times faster compared to what,740.459,3.421
we had on Lightning so this is going to,742.44,4.139
be great for transferring stuff but the,743.88,5.76
iPhone 15 15 plus still have USB 2 speed,746.579,5.401
so that's up to 400 180 megabits a,749.64,3.9
second now I'm not sure why Apple have,751.98,3.539
done this I'm assuming because they're,753.54,4.919
not expecting iPhone 15 and 15 plus,755.519,4.981
users to be able to need those faster,758.459,3.961
transfer speeds such as for prores video,760.5,3.54
recording which you can't do now for,762.42,4.44
charging we still have 20 watts of wide,764.04,4.32
charging supported so you're going to,766.86,4.68
get around 50 in 35 minutes Q wireless,768.36,5.46
charging is supported up to 7.5 Watts,771.54,4.08
but if you do want faster wireless,773.82,3.66
charging you will have to use magsafe,775.62,4.74
and that is at 15 watts now in terms of,777.48,5.58
the battery life on Apple's website it,780.36,4.14
is claim that we're going to be getting,783.06,3.42
the same battery life as the 14 pro Max,784.5,4.2
in my usage over the past few days it,786.48,3.84
does seem to be quite similar to my 14,788.7,3.84
April Max and I am actually very happy,790.32,4.199
with my battery life in the 14 pro Max I,792.54,3.78
know some people haven't been I'm not,794.519,3.481
actually sure if the battery size is,796.32,3.9
exactly the same as the 14 pro Max,798.0,4.019
because it is lighter I'm not sure if,800.22,3.6
that's only thanks to the titanium or,802.019,3.361
because it has a slightly smaller,803.82,3.78
battery and potentially the more,805.38,6.42
efficient chip so we do have the 817 Pro,807.6,6.6
which is the industry's first three,811.8,5.039
nanometer chipset and in comparison to,814.2,5.52
the a16 bionic this will give you up to,816.839,5.401
20 faster GPU performance up to 10,819.72,4.619
percent faster CPU performance or you're,822.24,3.18
going to notice down the day today,824.339,3.841
probably not the iPhone 14 pro Max is,825.42,4.56
still very fast and handles everything,828.18,3.599
that I throw at it however there are,829.98,3.299
some really interesting improvements on,831.779,4.321
the a17 pro we have up to four times,833.279,6.0
faster Ray tracing than the a16 bionic,836.1,5.46
now this is not the first time we've,839.279,4.381
seen Ray tracing on a smartphone but,841.56,3.959
apparently according to the Keynotes,843.66,4.44
anyway this is the best in the industry,845.519,4.5
and what's most interesting for me is,848.1,2.88
that we're going to be able to get,850.019,4.44
console level games on the iPhone 15 pro,850.98,5.88
and pro Max such as Resident Evil,854.459,4.021
Village which we'll be using the same,856.86,3.419
assets that you have on a game console,858.48,4.919
as well as Assassin's Creed Mirage this,860.279,4.68
will be the first time an Assassin's,863.399,3.481
Creed is going to be natively available,864.959,3.901
on a smartphone I am so excited about,866.88,4.5
this honestly huge Assassin's Creed,868.86,4.02
friend let me know if you guys are too,871.38,3.3
and this should hopefully open up the,872.88,3.66
doors to many more console games which,874.68,3.18
you'll be able to play on your,876.54,3.239
smartphone one advantage that you have,877.86,3.539
on the new iPhones is that they support,879.779,3.841
HDR so for compatible games you'll be,881.399,3.781
able to get HDR which you might not have,883.62,3.06
been able to get otherwise now let's,885.18,3.0
quickly take a look around we have,886.68,2.76
nothing on the top on the right hand,888.18,3.3
side we have the power button on the,889.44,3.899
left hand side we have the volume,891.48,4.62
buttons the SIM card tray if you are not,893.339,6.0
in the US as well as the action button,896.1,6.179
now traditionally on an iPhone we've had,899.339,5.041
the mute switch now for somebody like,902.279,4.261
myself who's had my phone on silent,904.38,5.88
since probably 2008 the mute switch was,906.54,5.52
pretty pointless because it would always,910.26,3.48
stay on mute,912.06,4.32
the action button now brings lots more,913.74,4.44
possibilities and I'm so glad it's here,916.38,4.74
you can fully customize this so you can,918.18,5.279
use it as a mute switch if you wanted to,921.12,4.68
but you can also use it now to launch,923.459,4.261
the camera for example start a voice,925.8,4.02
memo for shortcuts so you can pretty,927.72,4.26
much make your iPhone launch whatever,929.82,4.56
you want it to the interface is really,931.98,4.56
nice and you can also launch different,934.38,4.019
states so for example if you're somebody,936.54,4.14
who likes to take lots of selfies on,938.399,4.5
your camera then you can have it so that,940.68,4.14
when you do press and hold this button,942.899,3.601
then it's going to straight away take,944.82,5.04
you in to selfie mode or maybe to start,946.5,5.459
a video I've personally set it to launch,949.86,4.26
the camera this is something that I,951.959,4.44
normally have on my Android phones as,954.12,3.959
well I can double press the power button,956.399,3.721
to launch the camera really useful when,958.079,3.601
you just quickly want the camera to,960.12,3.6
capture a moment and when you are within,961.68,4.38
the camera you can use the action button,963.72,3.78
as a shutter button to take pictures,966.06,4.019
which is also really nice now as far as,967.5,4.56
I can see you have to press and hold,970.079,3.541
this there are different states like I,972.06,3.3
would would have liked to have had press,973.62,4.079
once press and hold press twice for,975.36,4.26
something else I think these are all,977.699,3.721
possible and they will probably come,979.62,3.659
with a software update but right now,981.42,3.719
anyway I'm so glad that the action,983.279,3.3
button is here and it's going to be so,985.139,3.421
so useful for me and at the bottom of,986.579,4.141
course we do have the USB type-c port we,988.56,3.839
have the speaker grilles so we do have,990.72,3.78
stereo speakers on both we've got one,992.399,4.021
bottom firing and one in the earpiece,994.5,4.74
face ID is still here within the dynamic,996.42,4.74
Island and it works well as expected we,999.24,3.779
still have crash detection we still have,1001.16,4.38
emergency SOS via satellite finally,1003.019,6.12
let's talk about pricing and storage so,1005.54,5.76
the iPhone 15 Pro will be starting with,1009.139,5.341
128 gigabytes of storage for around a,1011.3,5.219
thousand dollars which is the same price,1014.48,5.099
that the 128 gigabyte or the D14 Pro,1016.519,6.601
started at last year in the US the,1019.579,6.441
iPhone 15 Pro Max will now start with,1023.12,6.719
256 gigabytes as base storage and this,1026.02,7.179
is at 1200 in the US which is the same,1029.839,6.84
price that the iPhone 14 pro Max 256,1033.199,6.901
version started at last year in the UK,1036.679,6.66
however we have had a price reduction so,1040.1,6.06
the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro,1043.339,4.98
Max actually starts at lower prices,1046.16,4.38
compared to what the 14 pro and pro Max,1048.319,3.841
started at last year we're looking at,1050.54,5.16
around 100 up to 150 pounds when we go,1052.16,5.82
for the one terabyte version I'm not,1055.7,4.26
sure why this is maybe the economic,1057.98,3.96
situation has changed maybe they didn't,1059.96,4.5
sell as many in the UK I don't know but,1061.94,4.44
it's definitely good to see that the,1064.46,4.32
prices are back to somewhat normal I,1066.38,3.9
mean still they're very expensive but,1068.78,3.66
back to somewhat normal comparable to,1070.28,4.74
what we have in the US so those are my,1072.44,4.859
early thoughts and opinions after using,1075.02,4.98
the iPhone 15 Pro Max over the past few,1077.299,5.281
days as mentioned there is a detailed,1080.0,4.14
supersaf style camera comparison coming,1082.58,3.9
up so do not forget to subscribe and hit,1084.14,4.68
that Bell icon is there anything else,1086.48,3.96
you'd like me to cover with the iPhone,1088.82,4.8
15 Pro Max or even the iPhone 15s drum,1090.44,4.979
give me a comment below let me know and,1093.62,3.84
I'll try to work on as much content as I,1095.419,4.021
can don't forget to pick up the super,1097.46,3.719
SAS style sunglasses while you can,1099.44,3.42
before they go out of stock the link,1101.179,3.781
will be down in the description below if,1102.86,3.66
you want to see my coverage of all of,1104.96,4.079
the new iPhones I've done those here as,1106.52,4.08
well as my detailed review of the iPhone,1109.039,4.081
14 a pro Max a few months ago yeah I,1110.6,3.6
hope you enjoyed this video and found it,1113.12,2.64
useful if you did do smash that like,1114.2,2.94
button for me thanks for watching this,1115.76,3.48
is iPhone supersaf TV and I'll see you,1117.14,4.34
next time,1119.24,2.24
what's going on guys it's your average,0.0,5.279
consumer and as you know it's iPhone day,1.56,7.02
so today we are going to unbox a bunch,5.279,5.521
of iPhones and accessories and cool,8.58,3.3
things you're going to want to check out,10.8,3.419
for the newest lineup so let's get right,11.88,3.839
into it all right so we've got our 15,14.219,4.281
Pros over here put that off to the side,15.719,6.781
and these are the new 15s so we've got,18.5,8.199
the 15 in yellow and the 15 plus in pink,22.5,5.699
I feel like Pink's getting a lot of the,26.699,3.0
attention these days so let's go ahead,28.199,4.761
and unbox this one first,29.699,3.261
there you have it,35.76,5.76
and man even listen when we dropped the,37.86,4.5
video,41.52,3.84
and I said this is a new look for the,42.36,6.539
iPhone everyone went nuts and said it's,45.36,5.219
exactly the same,48.899,3.721
well guys listen to me what Apple has,50.579,5.101
done here with the color is definitely a,52.62,4.259
new thing but we're going to touch on,55.68,2.58
the color in just a second we're gonna,56.879,2.82
see what else we have in the Box,58.26,5.7
although the way this looks and feels,59.699,6.061
I'm not gonna lie it's nice but all,63.96,4.56
right also inside of the Box we now get,65.76,6.84
a USBC to C cable because as you know,68.52,6.9
the iPhone no longer has a lightning,72.6,6.6
Port it now has USB C and with the USBC,75.42,6.36
you get included in the box it is a,79.2,4.2
braided cable so this is a similar,81.78,3.12
braided cable to what we see with some,83.4,3.6
of the more expensive Apple products I'm,84.9,4.8
talking the Mac Pros colored IMAX Apple,87.0,4.38
watch Ultra they all have like this,89.7,3.779
braided look and now that's coming down,91.38,4.14
to all of the iPhones you know it's,93.479,3.661
going to be so confusing for folks who,95.52,3.66
say hey you got an iPhone charger,97.14,4.38
I think I'd be like which one but we,99.18,5.579
also get some paperwork very minimal,101.52,6.54
paperwork here e-sim card sticker and,104.759,6.0
some safety information over here and,108.06,4.14
that's pretty much it but now let's take,110.759,4.201
a look at the 15 and like I said we got,112.2,4.5
it here in pink so here's what's new,114.96,3.479
about this you guys so Apple has changed,116.7,3.599
the way they implement the color on the,118.439,4.561
iPhone it's actually infused into the,120.299,5.46
glass and now it has like this matte,123.0,6.06
texture to it uh it feels really nice,125.759,6.06
and the color is really subtle like I'm,129.06,4.679
not a pink lover but even this pink,131.819,4.14
looks really good the way it's done,133.739,4.201
I like it a lot there are actually a few,135.959,3.301
different colors here there's pink,137.94,5.64
yellow blue green and black and I'd say,139.26,8.16
the yellow green and blue are on the,143.58,5.82
Lighter Side they don't have a ton of,147.42,3.959
color not as saturated as the pink pink,149.4,3.54
definitely pops quite a bit more in,151.379,3.901
person so let's go ahead,152.94,4.74
take that thing off,155.28,5.36
and power it on,157.68,2.96
oh you know what Jay you're right this,160.76,4.42
is going to be great for fingerprints if,163.62,3.36
you're bold enough to walk around with,165.18,3.3
no case,166.98,3.18
fingerprints are not going to be a,168.48,4.259
concern as much not only because of the,170.16,4.38
lighter color when you've got a lighter,172.739,3.72
device you don't really see fingerprints,174.54,4.699
as easily but this material overall,176.459,5.341
definitely not a fingerprint magnet and,179.239,4.181
the sides,181.8,3.48
yeah Jay I think you'd be pretty safe,183.42,3.2
even for you,185.28,4.02
I'm pretty bad but Jay's worst and I,186.62,4.72
think we'd both be okay and immediately,189.3,3.719
one of the changes that I'm noticing are,191.34,4.56
the rounded edges now we're not talking,193.019,5.281
about the corners or anything we're,195.9,4.86
talking about the actual edges of the,198.3,4.82
frame and those are more rounded now,200.76,4.8
feels a bit more comfortable to hold in,203.12,5.259
the hand and even having it rest on the,205.56,4.74
pinky Jay like we talked about I think,208.379,3.481
it's not going to do as much damage as,210.3,3.6
it's done before bottom of course we've,211.86,4.56
got that USBC port and what's nice is,213.9,4.619
that they even color match the inside of,216.42,4.319
the port as well so depending on what,218.519,4.14
color you get it'll match on the inside,220.739,4.56
but overall the rest of like the buttons,222.659,4.921
you still got your mute switch here all,225.299,3.901
of that is still the same physically,227.58,4.019
what's different though is we no longer,229.2,4.92
have a notch on the screen so now we've,231.599,4.681
got the dynamic Island that we first saw,234.12,5.22
introduced with the 14 pro now it's made,236.28,5.64
its way across the entire line so with,239.34,4.02
this you'll be able to get notification,241.92,3.12
or see the status of different,243.36,4.14
applications and you'll also be able to,245.04,4.32
interact with those applications while,247.5,4.319
you're doing other things it's a very,249.36,5.04
very neat feature and I'm glad that,251.819,4.14
everyone's now going to be able to use,254.4,3.42
it that also means it's going to get,255.959,3.78
more popular we'll see more apps take,257.82,3.96
advantage of it since all the iPhones,259.739,3.721
are using this feature now so now you'll,261.78,2.82
be able to see all the things that the,263.46,3.6
dynamic Island brings to the table you,264.6,4.74
also just get quite a bit more screen at,267.06,4.199
the top so clearly this is like a new,269.34,3.96
screen but one more thing that's new,271.259,4.261
about this screen is that it's going to,273.3,4.74
get quite a bit brighter so we got a,275.52,4.679
thousand nits of brightness here with a,278.04,4.86
peak brightness of 1600 nits so when,280.199,5.341
you're watching like HDR content but if,282.9,4.56
you're outdoors and it's like crazy,285.54,4.56
sunny or something this can go all the,287.46,5.16
way up to 2 000 nits so I'm curious to,290.1,4.02
see if we can get that triggered I want,292.62,4.74
to see what that's like but 2006 is a,294.12,5.04
really good thing on the back,297.36,4.14
we've got our two cameras we've got our,299.16,4.8
48 megapixel wide angle lens as well as,301.5,4.86
our 12 megapixel Ultra wide but because,303.96,4.44
you can basically crop in a bit with,306.36,5.16
this 48 megapixel lens and get a tighter,308.4,5.22
shot Apple says like you know it's like,311.52,4.92
having three lenses on your phone not,313.62,4.859
something we've seen typically with the,316.44,3.96
standard iPhone lineup that aren't the,318.479,4.56
pros and it pans out now on the inside,320.4,5.519
we've got the a16 bionic processor the,323.039,5.22
same chip that was in the iPhone 14 pro,325.919,4.141
lineup so we've now got that power on,328.259,3.541
the standard lineup which should be a,330.06,4.68
good jump from the 14 and 14 plus so,331.8,5.04
boom that's your super quick rundown of,334.74,5.76
the iPhone 15 or 15 plus let's at least,336.84,5.639
take a look at the color of this 15 that,340.5,3.44
we've got over here,342.479,4.921
there we have it you see this yellow,343.94,7.66
is so light it's really light man I,347.4,6.54
don't know that smaller form factor is,351.6,3.36
it,353.94,3.06
is this the year I go down to the 15 Pro,354.96,4.86
and not the max no it's not all right so,357.0,4.979
we've got our 15 and 15 plus over here,359.82,5.099
now let's take a look at these guys,361.979,4.94
which one do we do first,364.919,5.041
okay fair enough let's do it,366.919,6.961
so right here we've got the 15,369.96,3.92
Pro that blue looks good man dang no,374.18,6.7
this,379.56,3.54
I don't know it was between natural,380.88,4.92
titanium and blue the Blue's looking,383.1,4.14
really good so there's a couple colors,385.8,3.6
with the new Pro lineup there's blue,387.24,5.579
black white and natural titanium so,389.4,6.359
those are your four color options I feel,392.819,4.801
like natural titanium is getting a lot,395.759,3.121
of attention,397.62,3.48
so let's open that up right now too and,398.88,3.48
I mean,401.1,3.539
inside the pro box is the same as the 15,402.36,5.7
box nothing different here natural,404.639,6.321
titanium,408.06,2.9
okay this it does look good too though,411.479,6.66
not gonna lie see what's nice about the,414.979,5.921
natural titanium is that it also matches,418.139,5.521
the app watch Ultra so it's the same,420.9,5.88
natural titanium look so you've got like,423.66,6.42
a matching iPhone for this uh watch so,426.78,4.8
that's like one of the nice little,430.08,3.239
bonuses there so all of them feature,431.58,3.42
this brushed titanium,433.319,3.481
and they all look really good but you,435.0,3.18
know what let's talk about this titanium,436.8,4.619
a little bit more right so now the,438.18,5.94
iPhone actually has slightly smaller,441.419,6.601
bezels so it's 0.9 millimeters thinner,444.12,7.079
on all sides so it's a slightly smaller,448.02,5.459
body and we've got those rounded edges,451.199,4.321
that we also saw on the 15 and that's,453.479,4.5
interesting so it's like basically a,455.52,4.679
smaller iPhone but you still keep the,457.979,5.101
same screen size as like the 14 pro Max,460.199,6.06
or 14 pro now the pros also have USBC at,463.08,4.98
the bottom now there is a difference,466.259,4.56
between this USBC and the one you can,468.06,5.699
find here so this one uses USB 2 while,470.819,6.361
this one uses USB 3 basically what that,473.759,5.761
means you guys for the everyday person,477.18,5.6
uh this is going to transfer data faster,479.52,6.299
than these guys over here so if you're,482.78,4.9
you know moving files around a lot,485.819,4.021
you're moving around a lot of media or,487.68,4.44
something this one is going to transfer,489.84,5.72
faster now also on this titanium I phone,492.12,7.919
we've got the action button now I've,495.56,6.039
been waiting for the action button for a,500.039,2.761
long time we've seen it on Android,501.599,3.481
phones and I am very happy we have it,502.8,4.32
here as well now this button is really,505.08,4.92
cool because by default it'll still mute,507.12,5.58
and unmute your phone uh but you can go,510.0,5.039
ahead and change that to whatever action,512.7,4.68
you'd like so really quick rundown if,515.039,4.201
you've got the action button set as your,517.38,5.459
ringer toggle uh a quick press will show,519.24,6.06
you the status of it and a long press,522.839,5.161
will actually change it so quick press,525.3,5.82
you get the status long press you can,528.0,5.04
see it change now you can actually go,531.12,4.26
into the settings here and it's got this,533.04,5.22
whole cool UI where you can see all of,535.38,4.26
the different things that you can change,538.26,3.74
the action button to you can even create,539.64,4.86
shortcuts so if you wanted to do some,542.0,4.72
elaborate thing with your smart home and,544.5,4.44
home kit you'll actually be able to,546.72,4.08
control it with the Press of a button,548.94,4.14
I'm gonna probably just have it as my,550.8,4.159
camera or my flashlight,553.08,4.319
surprisingly I use my flashlight a lot,554.959,4.421
and I'm not the only one I saw a lot of,557.399,4.5
people say flashlight as well so I'm not,559.38,5.7
crazy now let's talk about the cameras,561.899,5.161
in the back so we've always had our,565.08,4.5
Ultra wide lens which lets you see a,567.06,4.62
whole lot in your frame,569.58,5.16
uh but that lens also doubles as a macro,571.68,4.74
lens so if you want to get like really,574.74,4.02
close to a subject uh you'll be able to,576.42,4.8
get a really close-up shot think like,578.76,5.22
having a microscope not to that level,581.22,4.799
but something similar and you also get,583.98,4.74
those wide shots that's two lenses now,586.019,5.401
you have your 48 megapixel wide angle,588.72,5.16
lens and this will allow you to shoot in,591.42,4.26
a couple of different focal lengths now,593.88,4.2
with this 48 megapixel camera you'll be,595.68,4.62
able to shoot at 24 millimeter 28,598.08,4.74
millimeter 35 millimeter and when you,600.3,4.68
hit two times you'll get your 48,602.82,3.66
millimeter so you've got those four,604.98,3.12
different focal lengths running off of,606.48,4.62
the 48 megapixel camera and what's nice,608.1,5.34
here is when you zoom in you're not,611.1,4.679
losing quality we've all seen digital,613.44,5.16
Zoom kind of destroy pictures but,615.779,3.901
thankfully we're not going to be,618.6,3.179
experiencing that when you're switching,619.68,3.36
between those different focal lengths,621.779,4.021
and for our last one we've got our,623.04,4.2
telephoto and they're different,625.8,3.659
depending on the 15 pro model that you,627.24,5.219
go with on this one the regular 15 Pro,629.459,5.761
you're looking at a 77 millimeter,632.459,4.201
telephoto lens,635.22,4.559
and on the 15 Pro Max you're looking at,636.66,6.84
the 120 millimeter five-time optical,639.779,6.361
zoom so three times here five times here,643.5,4.8
so if you need a little bit more you,646.14,3.6
probably want to look at the max and,648.3,3.24
those RS7 lenses now something that the,649.74,3.9
15 lineup has access to with these,651.54,3.78
cameras is something I've been dying for,653.64,4.74
for a long time and that is being able,655.32,6.0
to turn live photos into portrait mode,658.38,5.28
photos so these new cameras are going to,661.32,4.459
be able to capture the depth information,663.66,5.04
now it does it automatically for faces,665.779,7.06
of humans as well as dogs and cats but,668.7,6.36
if you tap the subject it should also be,672.839,3.961
able to produce that but it does it,675.06,3.48
automatically for those three categories,676.8,3.779
uh but that is something that I've been,678.54,4.44
dying for so we are going to absolutely,680.579,4.32
test that out now in terms of the screen,682.98,3.72
on the pro it's a little bit different,684.899,4.68
from the standard 15s this one does have,686.7,5.699
Pro motion so it goes up to 120 and it,689.579,5.401
also goes up to 2000 nits of like really,692.399,4.921
Peak brightness Outdoors now inside of,694.98,6.72
this guy we've got the a17 pro now that,697.32,7.139
is a new chip Apple switched up the name,701.7,4.62
they moved away from bionic and now,704.459,4.021
they're straight up calling it pro and,706.32,3.42
this is going to unlock a few things,708.48,2.34
we're going to see new camera,709.74,3.839
capabilities with the photonic engine so,710.82,5.22
it should make pictures even better,713.579,5.641
we're testing that out for sure but one,716.04,4.979
thing that's really got my attention,719.22,4.32
with having the amount of power that the,721.019,6.121
a17 pro brings is gaming so we are now,723.54,6.66
going to be seeing Triple A titles come,727.14,5.52
to the iPhone Resident Evil is going to,730.2,4.199
be coming out for this as well as an,732.66,4.5
Assassin's Creed which is also coming,734.399,5.94
out for like consoles so is Apple really,737.16,5.82
creating the Next Generation the gaming,740.339,4.021
console they've been talking about it,742.98,3.78
for years now and it looks like they're,744.36,4.26
getting closer and closer to that being,746.76,4.019
a reality so we're starting to go from,748.62,5.279
like just mobile games to console games,750.779,6.481
that are on like the PS5 Xbox come down,753.899,5.88
to this now I'm quite interested in,757.26,4.62
seeing what this is all going to feel,759.779,4.261
like when you're actually using it so,761.88,3.899
stay tuned to a real Day in the Life,764.04,3.539
with all of these phones that's going to,765.779,3.12
be coming really soon so make sure,767.579,3.361
you're subscribed to the channel if you,768.899,3.301
want to see what it's like to like,770.94,3.36
actually use it in the real world and,772.2,3.78
not just talk numbers now something,774.3,3.3
worth mentioning is that all the iPhones,775.98,3.599
pretty much keep the same pricing models,777.6,5.64
uh except for the 15 Pro Max this one,779.579,7.021
now starts at 256 gigs of storage and it,783.24,6.18
starts at 11.99 so they basically cut,786.6,5.28
out the 128 gig option so if you are,789.42,3.84
interested in that you're gonna have to,791.88,2.94
go One Step Up,793.26,4.259
it's not a price increase but it is a,794.82,4.86
higher entry point for uh the max,797.519,4.56
version I gotta say the whole rounded,799.68,5.64
edges thing I was kind of like meh no,802.079,5.281
big deal until you really hold it now,805.32,3.9
that I'm holding like the phone that,807.36,4.68
could potentially be my actual phone it,809.22,4.739
feels quite a bit of a difference so,812.04,3.239
this right here,813.959,5.101
is my 14 pro Max oh yeah,815.279,6.661
oh yeah now that it honestly matters I'm,819.06,5.959
gonna throw a case on this like ASAP,821.94,5.579
so you don't need a case it does have,825.019,5.201
easier repairability so,827.519,5.581
I mean that's true,830.22,4.38
I still don't want to have to deal with,833.1,2.46
that,834.6,2.64
so I'm still using a case and speaking,835.56,4.38
of cases we've actually got quite a few,837.24,5.94
here so these are Apple's new,839.94,5.94
fine woven cases as well as their,843.18,6.42
silicone cases so this is the fine woven,845.88,5.639
material here,849.6,4.56
and it feels like it feels like I mean,851.519,4.741
it's woven it feels like cloth it's,854.16,4.919
really nice looking I am wondering how,856.26,4.5
it's going to hold up in terms of,859.079,3.661
durability it looks really nice but,860.76,3.48
we're gonna have to put this thing to,862.74,3.18
the test kind of see how it is to use,864.24,5.659
this let's pop the phone in and see it,865.92,3.979
all right and there we have it but they,870.36,6.36
also still have silicone cases so let's,873.0,6.48
go for the yellow one that's a yellow,876.72,4.979
well this is not yellow it's like an,879.48,3.719
orange I'm matching it up with yellow,881.699,3.601
but this is more of an orange a really,883.199,4.38
light orange and you know tried and true,885.3,4.26
silicone case feels like you'd expect,887.579,4.38
very grippy I'm always I've always been,889.56,4.5
a fan of the silicone cases now you know,891.959,4.44
we got more accessories here and we're,894.06,5.219
going to jump right into the new airpods,896.399,4.74
second generation,899.279,3.541
second generation,901.139,3.121
the second generation of the second,902.82,6.079
generation airpods now with USBC,904.26,4.639
so of course paperwork quick start guide,909.12,4.86
that kind of deal and here we've got the,911.76,4.079
new airpods,913.98,3.719
underneath it,915.839,4.8
we've got our braided cable which has,917.699,6.841
USB C to C and above that we've got some,920.639,7.2
extra silicone tips from extra small,924.54,6.359
small to large and of course medium's,927.839,4.56
already on it now let's pop this thing,930.899,3.8
open,932.399,2.3
and here we have it these are the new,935.399,3.481
airpods but,937.32,4.44
with USB type c now these are,938.88,4.079
interesting because they've also been,941.76,3.9
updated with USB type c but the,942.959,5.041
architecture on the audio side has also,945.66,4.02
changed so that this thing can work and,948.0,4.44
give you lossless audio with the Apple,949.68,5.159
Vision Pro now with also new with these,952.44,3.66
earbuds is that you're going to have,954.839,4.021
access to adaptive audio as long as your,956.1,5.88
device has iOS 17 so get that adaptive,958.86,5.52
audio where it mixes the world of noise,961.98,4.34
cancellation and transparency mode,964.38,5.16
depending on your environment it allows,966.32,5.68
certain sounds in so maybe like a car,969.54,4.26
honking its horn because you know when,972.0,3.3
you're in active noise cancellation mode,973.8,3.06
you really can't hear that kind of thing,975.3,3.779
so it Blends the worlds to make sure you,976.86,4.02
get the important sounds in that's,979.079,2.76
something we're gonna have to try out,980.88,3.06
and see for ourselves and there's also,981.839,4.321
another cool feature called conversation,983.94,4.8
mode where basically when you speak to,986.16,4.979
someone is going to drop the volume down,988.74,4.68
open up the transparency mode allow you,991.139,4.44
to have your conversation once you're,993.42,4.2
done with that conversation it should go,995.579,4.801
ahead and kick the music back on so some,997.62,4.32
features that we've seen with like other,1000.38,4.319
devices like the Sony's but I'm curious,1001.94,4.74
to see how well Apple implements it to,1004.699,3.661
the airpods so that's what we've got,1006.68,3.659
here and I'm really excited to try it,1008.36,4.68
out but what's special about having USB,1010.339,5.521
type c is that if you've got an iPhone,1013.04,5.46
also with USB type c,1015.86,5.7
you'll now be able to charge it so you,1018.5,5.64
can take your USB let's grab any of,1021.56,5.759
these your USBC cable plug it in here,1024.14,7.86
and you can plug this one in here,1027.319,6.781
and we are now charging baby and you,1032.0,3.24
still get access to the Quick Charge,1034.1,3.479
features here uh when using it with the,1035.24,3.78
iPhone you know the iPhone can charge,1037.579,4.26
like other iPhones now right well it can,1039.02,4.86
it can charge pretty much I think any,1041.839,5.701
device with USB PD so that's that's kind,1043.88,5.22
of nice the question is what happens if,1047.54,3.84
you charge two iPhones,1049.1,4.8
well whichever has the most battery is,1051.38,4.679
going to be with the one that charges oh,1053.9,3.659
okay what happens if they're both at,1056.059,2.941
like 50 though,1057.559,4.201
does the world explode but yeah these,1059.0,4.32
are the new airpods I'm going to,1061.76,3.96
probably do a full video on this so make,1063.32,4.14
sure you're sub for that as well and I,1065.72,4.02
almost missed the fine woven wallet,1067.46,4.56
let's check this out it's a really nice,1069.74,4.439
material I I'm just curious how it's,1072.02,4.26
going to hold up but it's nice now we've,1074.179,4.441
got one more accessory here and this is,1076.28,4.74
from Belkin actually now we all know iOS,1078.62,5.16
17 is hitting the iPhones and there's a,1081.02,4.32
feature called nightstand I think,1083.78,4.62
nightstand mode and this is basically,1085.34,5.52
going to enable you to do that so let's,1088.4,5.76
take a look here really really simple so,1090.86,5.46
it is a wireless charger of course with,1094.16,6.12
magsafe inside of here let's see,1096.32,6.06
charging cable but this is a feature,1100.28,3.48
that we'll talk about in another video,1102.38,3.9
but if you're interested in you know,1103.76,4.919
actually using nightstand mode this is,1106.28,4.08
an option now there's a lot out there,1108.679,3.781
I'm going to be having an accessories,1110.36,4.199
video so you guys be on the lookout for,1112.46,5.219
that as well uh where you can see a few,1114.559,4.801
options that are kind of unlock this,1117.679,4.801
feature but that's about it that is our,1119.36,7.14
quick unboxing of everything that is new,1122.48,7.439
with apple except for the Apple watch we,1126.5,4.98
didn't get our hands on the app watch,1129.919,2.701
just yet,1131.48,3.6
so stay tuned for another video on that,1132.62,4.2
we'll be unboxing that and checking it,1135.08,2.94
out,1136.82,4.02
um but yeah these are the newest iPhones,1138.02,4.56
and some of the accessories that you can,1140.84,3.959
get your hands on lots of videos coming,1142.58,4.44
soon you guys so definitely stay tuned,1144.799,4.681
we got a lot to talk about until next,1147.02,4.5
video guys your average consumer,1149.48,3.36
peace,1151.52,3.24
I also have everything like linked down,1152.84,4.199
below so you guys can check it out,1154.76,4.7
later,1157.039,2.421
sometimes technological progress is Big,0.979,5.561
sometimes it's small but those small,3.86,5.62
changes can add up to a lot and with,6.54,5.46
enough of them incremental progress can,9.48,3.96
be kind of a big deal,12.0,4.199
it also helps when EU Regulators get,13.44,4.679
involved and enforce a universal,16.199,4.021
charging standard that's how we ended up,18.119,6.561
here the first uspc iPhone,20.22,4.46
that's it,28.74,2.72
the new charging port is a big deal but,33.0,3.42
that's not the first thing you notice,35.1,4.02
about the iPhone 15 Pro in the 15 Pro,36.42,4.56
Max whether you're just taking a look or,39.12,3.599
picking them up you're going to notice,40.98,4.56
the new titanium exterior and frosted,42.719,5.581
glass it looks sleek the sides have a,45.54,5.039
brushed finish it's more comfortable to,48.3,4.8
hold and most importantly it's quite a,50.579,3.901
bit lighter than the stainless steel,53.1,3.66
that came before it on the Pro Models it,54.48,4.98
makes the 15 pro and pro Max 19 grams,56.76,4.74
lighter than their predecessors maybe,59.46,4.14
that doesn't sound like a lot but you,61.5,4.56
notice it especially on the pro Mac that,63.6,3.839
might be the thing that impacts your,66.06,3.18
experience using these phones more than,67.439,4.5
anything else Apple did this year and if,69.24,3.96
you want the bigger phone this year,71.939,3.661
you'll have to pay up the 15 Pro starts,73.2,5.04
at 9.99 but the pro Max jumps up to,75.6,5.879
11.99 you get 256 gigabytes of storage,78.24,5.1
at that price which is what it costs,81.479,4.5
last year but there's no 128 gigabyte,83.34,5.06
model so that's the new starting price,85.979,4.14
[Music],88.4,3.7
there's a lot more to cover but there's,90.119,3.421
one word I've been thinking about over,92.1,4.199
the past week and that's Pro these are,93.54,5.1
the pro models of course and apple even,96.299,6.061
renamed the a17 chipset Pro but what,98.64,6.0
exactly does it mean I mean it's short,102.36,4.32
for a professional but what's a,104.64,3.9
professional phone we've been poking fun,106.68,3.479
at this since Apple started putting the,108.54,4.14
word Pro on everything but it makes more,110.159,4.441
sense if you think of it as standing for,112.68,3.96
Progress we'll come back to that just,114.6,3.58
keep it in mind for now,116.64,2.7
[Music],118.18,2.84
let's look at one of the big new,119.34,3.419
hardware features this year not the,121.02,4.139
charging port the action button it's,122.759,3.96
next to the volume buttons and it takes,125.159,3.361
the place of the long-standing mute,126.719,3.721
switch by default it does the same thing,128.52,4.14
as a mute switch long press it to turn,130.44,4.32
all your sounds off and then long press,132.66,4.26
it again to turn them back on,134.76,4.14
but you can also make it do other things,136.92,4.44
just open up the settings menu it,138.9,4.559
randomly goes really hard with these,141.36,4.8
oddly mesmerizing animations and you can,143.459,4.561
program the action button to open the,146.16,4.2
camera or turn on your flashlight or,148.02,4.859
trigger an accessibility feature it can,150.36,4.68
also run shortcuts which means it can be,152.879,4.681
your order me a PSL button if you want,155.04,5.82
to just in theory,157.56,5.3
yeah that's it,160.86,5.22
is it perfect not quite I wish I could,162.86,5.5
program it to do a secondary action when,166.08,4.439
you double press it and on the pro Max,168.36,4.5
it's in kind of an awkward spot to reach,170.519,4.141
in the camera app you can use it as a,172.86,3.54
shutter but it's a little weird because,174.66,3.0
you feel like you're holding the camera,176.4,3.18
upside down but it's nice to be able to,177.66,3.6
customize this button and do just about,179.58,3.96
anything you wanted to especially since,181.26,3.9
Apple isn't exactly known for,183.54,4.62
customization options it's you know,185.16,5.48
progress,188.16,2.48
okay let's get to the port because,192.26,3.88
that's something that's going to affect,194.76,3.78
everyone who buys this phone it is,196.14,4.5
exactly what it looks like a USBC,198.54,3.9
connector just like the ones on,200.64,3.36
basically every other modern Android,202.44,4.56
phone on the Pro Models it's USB 3 which,204.0,5.34
enables faster transfer speeds at up to,207.0,4.62
10 gigabits per second,209.34,4.02
look at that cable,211.62,3.899
separately of course you can do quite a,213.36,4.5
bit with it too plug in a hub an SD card,215.519,4.8
reader ethernet Apple hasn't done a lot,217.86,4.799
of its usual gatekeeping here so most,220.319,3.48
things just work how they should,222.659,3.241
progress just don't plug your phone into,223.799,4.08
a display and expect to run a whole,225.9,4.919
desktop environment this isn't Dex for,227.879,4.86
some people this will mean you just need,230.819,4.14
to pick up an extra USBC charging brick,232.739,3.601
because you know you're not getting one,234.959,3.661
in the box but even if it's a little,236.34,4.08
inconvenient right now this is,238.62,4.679
overwhelmingly a good change you can,240.42,5.7
pack one charger for your MacBook your,243.299,5.16
iPad your phone and whatever other,246.12,5.839
modern devices you carry around,248.459,3.5
there's still three cameras on the back,252.68,4.239
of both Pro phones but one of them got,254.879,4.441
an upgrade the telephoto on the 15 Pro,256.919,5.761
Max is now a five times lens or 120,259.32,5.64
millimeter equivalent the 15 Pro still,262.68,3.66
has a three times zoom and there's,264.96,2.94
nothing really new about it the jump,266.34,4.799
from 3x to 5x is a noticeable one in it,267.9,5.04
opens up some interesting possibilities,271.139,3.721
for what you can do with Framing and,272.94,3.6
compression that you don't really get,274.86,3.72
with a shorter lens this is Apple's,276.54,4.08
first attempt at a long telephoto lens,278.58,4.5
and it's a good one there's plenty of,280.62,4.019
detail on good lighting and like,283.08,3.899
sensorship stabilizer which also does,284.639,4.921
double duty for autofocus seems to help,286.979,4.861
in dim light things get a little muddy,289.56,5.04
and low light but it's a small sensor so,291.84,4.859
that's not too surprising Apple's really,294.6,4.5
playing ketchup here the pixel 7 Pro has,296.699,4.56
a five times zoom and Samsung has put,299.1,4.26
10x Zoom cameras on its phones for years,301.259,4.681
but overall I like this five time lens,303.36,5.16
on the 15 Pro Max the two times crop on,305.94,4.02
the main camera is good enough for,308.52,3.899
shorter telephoto shots so a dedicated,309.96,5.28
3x lens feels a little redundant you,312.419,4.261
don't get the wow factor of something,315.24,4.44
like Samsung's 10x lens but it's you,316.68,5.28
know progress Becca will have another,319.68,4.56
video coming out soon diving deeper into,321.96,5.34
all of that so stay tuned for now I'm,324.24,4.739
happy with the changes Apple made here,327.3,3.72
feels like a much more flexible system,328.979,4.321
with the new Zoom options and I find,331.02,3.84
myself taking more shots that I would,333.3,3.179
have otherwise skipped without the long,334.86,3.899
telephoto lens that's the big news on,336.479,4.56
the hardware front the main 48 megapixel,338.759,4.321
camera in the ultra wide are basically,341.039,4.5
on change from the 14 pro but there are,343.08,4.26
a few interesting things happening in,345.539,4.081
the software too there are new 28,347.34,4.38
millimeter and 35 millimeter modes for,349.62,3.96
the main camera you can cycle between,351.72,4.62
them by tapping the one time zoom option,353.58,5.04
these aren't the result of basic digital,356.34,4.859
Zoom upresing Apple actually has a,358.62,4.32
separate processing pipeline for each of,361.199,3.901
them you can even change the default,362.94,5.699
focal length to 28 or 35 if 24 feels too,365.1,6.18
wide to you and I know several of you,368.639,4.081
who are going to do that immediately,371.28,3.359
when you get this phone another neat,372.72,3.78
update is that you can apply portrait,374.639,4.021
mode to certain photos after you take,376.5,4.32
them now anytime the camera detects a,378.66,5.099
person a cat a dog or whenever you tap,380.82,5.219
to focus in the frame a little f-stop,383.759,4.021
icon appears on the screen to let you,386.039,3.44
know that it's saving depth information,387.78,4.32
when you edit in the photos app you can,389.479,4.601
turn the portrait effect on and even,392.1,4.8
change the focus point this is a huge,394.08,4.8
victory for anyone who's ever struggled,396.9,4.2
switching modes while your pet or your,398.88,3.96
kid does something cute and you totally,401.1,3.539
miss the moment so there are some,402.84,4.079
changes in video mode too,404.639,6.12
take it away V hello so this year on the,406.919,5.881
iPhone 15 Pro and the pro Max you have,410.759,4.201
the ability to shoot in log meaning that,412.8,3.959
you can record video without a color,414.96,4.62
profile baked into your footage why does,416.759,4.621
that matter because folks like me video,419.58,3.839
creators can take advantage of more,421.38,3.659
dynamic range and they can easily,423.419,3.9
manipulate colors and match them to,425.039,4.861
other cameras too so yeah this is what,427.319,5.1
log looks like it looks flat there's no,429.9,5.82
color no or sharpening which is to say,432.419,5.521
that I love it but let's actually add,435.72,4.74
some color here so,437.94,4.92
a little transition so in order to do,440.46,4.26
what I just did you would have to use a,442.86,4.619
desktop app like Premiere or DaVinci or,444.72,5.28
Apple's own Final Cut Pro there will be,447.479,4.741
support for Final Cut Pro on the iPad,450.0,4.74
and other apps as well and you can,452.22,4.44
download Apple's provided Luts from,454.74,4.019
their developer websites right,456.66,4.259
let's go back and edit some footage okay,458.759,4.201
a few things that you should know in,460.919,4.141
order to film and log you can only film,462.96,5.1
in prores and those files can get pretty,465.06,5.1
large our review unit of the phone has,468.06,4.139
one terabyte of storage which gives you,470.16,5.4
a little over 150 or 160 minutes of,472.199,7.801
filming but hey we have USBC Port now so,475.56,6.479
you can just connect an external drive,480.0,4.759
for as much of storage as you need,482.039,5.521
actually you'll have to record straight,484.759,5.201
into an SSD drive if you want to shoot,487.56,6.12
past 4K 30s meaning 4K 60.,489.96,6.48
everything else 24 and 30 will work,493.68,4.62
straight onto the device I love having,496.44,4.199
an option to shoot Pros log on the phone,498.3,4.5
if you're an Apple device with an M1,500.639,4.381
chip or an M2 Chip editing these will,502.8,4.32
actually be super Breezy because there's,505.02,4.859
a dedicated prores accelerator and the,507.12,3.78
results are,509.879,3.84
really good and just to be clear prores,510.9,4.8
and log don't magically make your,513.719,4.26
footage much better you'll still get,515.7,4.139
similar performance out of the cameras,517.979,4.081
when it comes to things like noise but,519.839,4.62
having that flexibility to make your,522.06,5.64
Clips More You Is Awesome,524.459,5.221
and I think this is the part where I,527.7,5.52
declare progress but not the other Pro,529.68,6.839
word professional Apple being Apple the,533.22,5.76
camera interface didn't change here you,536.519,4.44
won't get the professional user,538.98,3.78
interface where you can manually set,540.959,4.861
shutter ISO and white balance for that,542.76,4.38
you'll have to wait for some more,545.82,4.199
third-party apps which we're told will,547.14,4.92
support block filming,550.019,5.461
progress lastly log doesn't work in,552.06,5.7
cinematic mode which I guess is to be,555.48,4.799
expected but it does work on all three,557.76,4.74
separate sensors there are no gotcha,560.279,3.481
moments here,562.5,3.779
and overall I'm impressed with how much,563.76,4.68
you can do here especially with the main,566.279,4.861
lens things do sort of fall apart with,568.44,4.68
the 5x Zoom there's just a bit too much,571.14,4.02
noise in low light and there's this,573.12,4.62
overall crunchiness in the image even,575.16,4.44
with sufficient light but the main,577.74,4.02
lesson prores log has pleasantly,579.6,4.919
surprised me all right Allison you're,581.76,3.48
next,584.519,2.101
progress,585.24,3.42
progress,586.62,3.96
there's a grab bag of other updates,588.66,4.14
worth mentioning like the new 17 Pro,590.58,4.5
chipset you heard that right it's not,592.8,6.12
the 17 bionic it's the 17 Pro because,595.08,6.42
you know it features a brand new GPU,598.92,5.16
that enables hardware-based Ray tracing,601.5,4.56
so you can enjoy console quality gaming,604.08,3.96
on your phone which is honestly really,606.06,4.44
impressive personally I don't think,608.04,4.979
Resident Evil Villages for me more of a,610.5,4.98
Sim City girl but yeah it looks really,613.019,5.281
good our new old friend Dynamic island,615.48,5.28
is still here and more third-party apps,618.3,4.32
like doordash are coming on board soon,620.76,4.139
Apple isn't making any claims of,622.62,4.44
improved battery life just that it'll,624.899,4.56
get through a full day of use we've been,627.06,4.56
putting the pro Max through a lot and I,629.459,4.201
did get through an entire day with lots,631.62,4.08
of video recording but the battery was,633.66,3.66
right down to the single digits that,635.7,3.42
night we noticed a lot of complaints,637.32,3.959
from 14 pro owners saying that their,639.12,4.26
maximum battery capacity is degraded,641.279,6.12
from 100 to 90 or even lower just in one,643.38,6.24
year which is pretty concerning Apple,647.399,4.201
hasn't mentioned any improvements to,649.62,4.5
overall battery health so that might be,651.6,4.2
something to look out for on the 15 Pro,654.12,4.32
there's a new Ultra wide man chip so you,655.8,4.32
can find your stuff or your friends with,658.44,4.019
more Precision provided they have an,660.12,4.2
iPhone 15 or one of the new Apple,662.459,4.201
watches too and and that they want you,664.32,4.199
to know where they are Apple's adding,666.66,4.14
roadside assistance to the emergency SOS,668.519,4.621
roster and we're still waiting to find,670.8,4.2
out how much that emergency satellite,673.14,4.68
service is bundled with is gonna cost in,675.0,5.04
the meantime iPhone 15 owners will get,677.82,4.38
two free years of access,680.04,4.38
Apple wants us to believe that the 15,682.2,4.5
Pro represents a kind of technological,684.42,4.26
progress that will open up new,686.7,4.8
possibilities and push boundaries I,688.68,4.92
think for most of us it's just progress,691.5,3.959
It's the next thing that's a little,693.6,3.84
better than the last sometimes in,695.459,4.081
significant ways but mostly in small,697.44,4.62
ways I can list a handful of things that,699.54,4.739
weren't on the 14 pro that I appreciate,702.06,5.279
having here nothing huge but plenty of,704.279,5.641
small conveniences that I'm enjoying,707.339,5.461
that's not as exciting as a big leap,709.92,5.7
forward but sometimes that's just what,712.8,5.599
progress looks like,715.62,2.779
and we can take it from oh you got,721.14,3.66
coffee all over your shirt I'm just,723.48,3.9
kidding oh my God don't,724.8,4.7
oh,727.38,2.12
if you're trying to decide between the,0.0,3.36
standard iPhone 15s and the iPhone 15,1.56,4.68
Pros there are 21 major differences to,3.36,5.22
consider also we've now revealed the,6.24,4.74
final teaser for what we are launching,8.58,5.04
and yes the launch is on September the,10.98,6.18
21st at 5 PM UK time when we cannot wait,13.62,5.4
to show you what we've been working on,17.16,3.66
in the background comment down below if,19.02,3.24
you have an idea of what we're launching,20.82,3.719
and you might win a special prize if,22.26,4.439
you're right okay so really the biggest,24.539,3.601
difference between the standard and the,26.699,4.021
Pro Models is the 120 hertz promotion,28.14,5.04
displays that the Pro Models have 120,30.72,5.28
hertz is a standard on Android phones at,33.18,5.52
pretty much any price range today and it,36.0,4.079
simply makes everything that you're,38.7,3.72
seeing and doing on your phone twice as,40.079,4.681
fluid 120 hertz is such a game changer,42.42,5.1
that a lot of the time a cheap 200 to,44.76,5.16
300 Android phone with a 120hz screen,47.52,5.34
will actually feel smoother than an 800,49.92,5.459
iPhone with a 60hz display I'd,52.86,4.08
personally say that 120 hertz is what,55.379,3.66
makes the Pro Models worth it in fact if,56.94,4.259
you cannot afford a 50 team pro I'd even,59.039,3.901
suggest getting last year's iPhone 14,61.199,4.801
pro as you'll get a 120hz display and a,62.94,4.38
lot of the features that the standard,66.0,3.36
iPhone 15s already come with the second,67.32,3.42
difference is that the Pro Models,69.36,3.84
feature an always on display that allows,70.74,3.6
you to see the time and your,73.2,3.599
notifications even when your phone is in,74.34,3.9
sleep Apple does have a different,76.799,3.0
always-on implementation compared to,78.24,3.66
Android where your wallpaper will also,79.799,5.041
be visible in full color just dimmed but,81.9,4.38
if you don't like that you can always,84.84,3.66
disable it and have the classic black,86.28,4.379
always on display or even disabled,88.5,4.2
entirely if you wish the best part about,90.659,4.441
the always on display is standby which,92.7,4.379
turns your iPhone into a clock a photo,95.1,4.5
frame or a smart home display while,97.079,4.381
charging this does work on the standard,99.6,3.479
models too it's just that you'll have to,101.46,3.9
tap the display to get it to show the,103.079,3.781
standby mode but not very advantage of,105.36,2.939
the Pro Models is that we get the new,106.86,3.299
action button that replaces the mute,108.299,3.721
switch which you can customize and,110.159,3.541
basically have it do anything the only,112.02,3.66
downside is that as of right now you can,113.7,4.62
only assign one action to it at one time,115.68,4.56
so if you configure a tube let's they,118.32,3.72
launched a camera you won't be able to,120.24,3.839
also mute your phone using it and you'll,122.04,3.42
have to do that from the control center,124.079,3.481
another difference is the frame which is,125.46,3.54
made out of aluminum on a standard,127.56,3.3
models compared to Titanium on the Pro,129.0,4.08
Models titanium is more durable than,130.86,4.5
aluminum but the aluminum frame is more,133.08,4.5
matte which I personally do prefer then,135.36,4.019
the non-pro models are actually lighter,137.58,4.26
with the 15 being 16 grams lighter than,139.379,5.041
the 15 Pro and the 15 plus being 20,141.84,4.619
grams lighter than the 15 Pro Max which,144.42,4.02
make the standard models more,146.459,4.081
comfortable to use for extended periods,148.44,4.2
of time another difference is the colors,150.54,4.14
the standard models come in some quite,152.64,4.319
playful colors like green yellow blue,154.68,4.68
and pink in addition to Black whereas,156.959,4.86
the pros only come in more professional,159.36,4.8
colors for lack of a better term like,161.819,4.861
silver black blue and natural titanium,164.16,4.02
this could be another reason to go for,166.68,3.9
one or the other also this year the,168.18,4.26
standard models get a frosted glass back,170.58,4.2
which make them look as good as the Pro,172.44,4.68
Models which I do really like I think,174.78,4.56
the matte black iPhone 15 looks by far,177.12,4.08
the best then we also get a number of,179.34,2.94
differences when it comes to the,181.2,2.88
performance first the Pro Models come,182.28,3.959
with Apple's a17 Pro chip released in,184.08,4.439
2023 whereas the standard models come,186.239,5.64
with a 2022 Apple a16 chip now they're,188.519,6.061
both very fast but the a17 pro enables,191.879,5.101
two additional features Ray tracing and,194.58,5.28
Triple A gains yes the Pro Models can,196.98,4.92
now play Triple A console games like,199.86,4.28
Resident Evil Village Resident Evil 4,201.9,4.5
deaths trending and even the upcoming,204.14,4.239
Assassin's Creed Mirage so if you're big,206.4,3.78
into Mobile gaming then the Pro Models,208.379,3.481
have a big Advantage here and the second,210.18,3.18
performance difference is that we get,211.86,3.42
more RAM on the Pro Models eight,213.36,3.72
gigabytes instead of six which should,215.28,3.539
allow you to keep more apps open in the,217.08,3.239
background without them having to reload,218.819,3.181
so often the Pro Models also come with,220.319,3.48
more storage the base storage is the,222.0,3.42
same on all of them 128 with the,223.799,2.881
exception of the pro Max which comes,225.42,4.2
with 256 but also costs more however the,226.68,5.04
top tier storage option is one terabyte,229.62,4.259
on the Pro Models compared to 512 on the,231.72,4.799
standard personally I'd say 512 is more,233.879,4.5
than enough for most people but if you,236.519,3.421
like taking a lot of photos and videos,238.379,4.44
and also want to save big games like AC,239.94,5.64
Mirage and have those on the go then I,242.819,5.161
can see why you might consider having a,245.58,4.799
one terabyte variant okay so now let's,247.98,4.2
talk about the camera differences so,250.379,3.241
even though both the standard models and,252.18,4.2
the pros have a 48 megapixel main sensor,253.62,5.459
Those sensors are not the same in fact,256.38,4.139
the standard models have a smaller,259.079,4.921
sensor with pixel sizes of two microns,260.519,7.021
compared to 244 on the Pro Models what,264.0,5.1
this means is that the Pro Models will,267.54,3.719
be better in low light than the standard,269.1,3.659
models and also have a bit more,271.259,3.601
background blur when taking both photos,272.759,4.141
and videos making them look a bit more,274.86,4.26
cinematic and the pro sensor also has a,276.9,4.38
more advanced sensor stabilization so,279.12,4.32
videos especially will be a bit more,281.28,3.72
stable now another advantage of the Pro,283.44,3.6
Models is that they also come with a,285.0,3.72
dedicated Zoom module that's why we have,287.04,3.9
three cameras instead of two now the,288.72,5.22
standard models also get a 2X sensor,290.94,4.979
cropped Zoom this time which does look,293.94,3.66
pretty good almost as good as a 2X,295.919,3.961
dedicated Zoo module but a 15 Pro offer,297.6,5.28
offers a 3X optical zoom lens and then,299.88,5.759
the 15 Pro Max offers a brand new 5x,302.88,4.56
optical zoom lens so if you're usually,305.639,3.181
the type of person that takes a lot of,307.44,3.42
landscape and cityscape shots and you,308.82,3.9
like to zoom in a lot then the iPhone 15,310.86,4.08
Pro Max especially will make a big,312.72,4.08
difference the Pro Models also have a,314.94,4.14
slightly better ultroid 2 that uses a,316.8,4.619
larger sensor and also a larger F 2.2,319.08,4.619
aperture compared to F 2.4 but what this,321.419,3.361
means is that the ultra light on the Pro,323.699,3.021
Models will be a bit better in low light,324.78,4.5
although I don't expect a night and day,326.72,4.24
difference then the Pro Models also give,329.28,3.24
you the ability to shoot macro photos,330.96,4.019
thanks to the autofocus support on the,332.52,4.86
ultroid module and I gotta say it is,334.979,5.041
pretty impressive how good macro mode is,337.38,4.92
on the Pro Models perfect for shooting,340.02,4.26
flowers or even insects and if you're,342.3,3.239
planning on buying apples super,344.28,3.96
expensive Apple Vision Pro you'll,345.539,5.22
definitely want to get the 15 Pros as,348.24,4.44
they are the only iPhones capable of,350.759,4.021
shooting 3D video that would then be,352.68,3.959
playable on division Pro headset,354.78,3.18
something else that you get with the Pro,356.639,3.241
Models is the lidar module which is this,357.96,4.86
black dot right here that lets you scan,359.88,5.099
your room or objects in 3D you can use,362.82,4.56
it to play AR games more accurately and,364.979,4.681
even measure objects and people plus the,367.38,3.9
lighter module is also being used for,369.66,3.84
portrait mode so you might see better,371.28,4.859
results from the Pro Models too and,373.5,4.68
speaking of the slider module night mode,376.139,4.021
portraits are also possible on the Pro,378.18,4.38
Models thanks to it and the Pro Models,380.16,3.78
also have an improved flash that is,382.56,3.0
brighter and also looks a bit more,383.94,3.42
realistic then the Pro Models also let,385.56,4.02
you take Pro Raw photos that allow you,387.36,4.38
to recover a lot of detail in case you,389.58,4.5
tend to edit your photos although you,391.74,4.2
could also use a third-party app and get,394.08,3.66
RAW support from the standard models too,395.94,4.379
that way and we also get prores on the,397.74,4.92
Pro Models which lets you capture more,400.319,4.32
detail in your videos allowing them to,402.66,4.44
be both sharper and easier to edit and,404.639,4.261
you can now connect an external SSD,407.1,4.74
directly through the USBC port and,408.9,5.639
record prores videos externally too on,411.84,4.199
top of this we also get the ability to,414.539,3.66
shoot in log on the Pro Models which is,416.039,3.78
this super flat picture profile that,418.199,4.321
allows you to color grade much easier,419.819,4.681
and then on top of that we also get some,422.52,4.08
other exclusive camera features for the,424.5,4.56
Pro Models like the ability to shoot 48,426.6,5.34
megapixel hif images the ability to pick,429.06,4.56
different Zoom levels for the main,431.94,3.96
camera and a couple more the Pro Models,433.62,4.5
also get a much faster USBC port with up,435.9,3.54
to 10 gigabits per second transfer,438.12,3.72
speeds as opposed to 480 megabits per,439.44,4.08
seconds like on the standard models,441.84,3.18
which means that if you want to transfer,443.52,2.82
loads of photos and videos to your,445.02,3.66
computer for editing then the Pro Models,446.34,5.04
would be 20 times faster in terms of,448.68,4.5
connectivity the Pro Models offer Wi-Fi,451.38,4.92
6E as opposed to Wi-Fi 6 with double the,453.18,5.579
speeds although one you also need to,456.3,5.16
have a Wi-Fi 60 router and two you also,458.759,4.021
need a very fast internet connection,461.46,3.359
which most people just don't have and,462.78,3.78
the Pro Models also get thread support,464.819,4.38
which is likely to become quite big in,466.56,4.32
the future and it will allow you to,469.199,3.301
control thread supported smart home,470.88,3.96
accessories directly without the need to,472.5,3.96
use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and the Pro,474.84,3.359
Models also offer an improved battery,476.46,4.44
life so 29 hours a video playback on the,478.199,5.22
15 Pro Max compared to 26 on the 15 plus,480.9,5.519
and then 23 on the 15 Pro compared to 20,483.419,5.881
on the 15. now if you're on a budget my,486.419,4.62
personal suggestion would be to Simply,489.3,5.28
get a refurbished 14 pro instead as it,491.039,4.741
will actually offer you most of the,494.58,4.14
features of the 15 Pro but at around the,495.78,5.759
same price as the 15. of course if,498.72,5.039
you're not on a budget then the 15 Pro,501.539,4.38
and especially the 15 Pro Max do offer,503.759,4.5
quite a bit more when compared to the,505.919,4.741
standard models it almost all regards if,508.259,4.261
you subscribe for more iPhone 15 content,510.66,4.679
and stay tuned for that big announcement,512.52,5.579
of ours on September the 21st from 5 PM,515.339,5.461
UK time I'm Daniel this means I'm Tech,518.099,4.62
and I'll see you guys in the next one so,520.8,4.19
no thanks something else cheers,522.719,9.901
[Music],524.99,10.289
thank you,532.62,2.659
