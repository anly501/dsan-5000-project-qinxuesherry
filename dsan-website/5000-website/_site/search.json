    "text": "1. Topics Introduction: Financial Fraud Detection\n\nsummary: There are many type of financial fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft, account takeover, payment fraud, insurance fraud, money laudering, etc.\nImportance: The financial institution need to collect data, for example, transaction data, account history, customers’ data, etc, to analyze and predict the financial fraud to avoid the financial fraud in the future.\nWhy the reader should continue: there are more and more new fraud methods came up, the past machine learning model might cannot apply to the new fraud methods.\nwhat work had done: The researchers had done many data collection, data preprocessing, and set up machine learning models to do the logistic regression, decision trees and random forest, etc. They also had done so many behavioral analysis to analyze transaction frequency, amount, time of day, etc.\nwhat are the “different points of views”/interpretations in the literature: There are many different points of views related to the financial fraud. From economic Perspective, they may analyze the costs of fraud prevention and the actual costs of fraud. From the data scientists’ perspective, they wish to focus more on using data-driving approaches to prevent fraud. There are also many other perspectives from different researchers.\nwhat exploring: In this area, we need to explore more about the relations between customers’ behavior and the fraud methods\ngoals and hypothesis: clean the data I collect and find some factors that impact the financial fraud and make a fraud detetction model."

The paper gave further insight into the applicability of Altman’s z-score and Dechow f-score to the exposure of false financial statements by Jordanian industrial owners. The duration of research included the years from 2015 to 2019. The Dependent variable in the analysis was the false financial statement, while the separate fraud factors were financial security, external strain, financial priorities and the essence of the business. The analysis of the research takes a methodological model utilizing a multiple regression procedure to evaluate the theories of the study. The final findings of the analysis presented conclusive proof that Jordanian manufacturing firms were engaged in the conduct of false financial statements; while some of the triangle fraud variables were identified without any correlation with fraudulent financial reports; other factors were found to be strongly associated with fraud. As regards the accuracy of the fraud models, the findings of the analysis confirmed the validity and specificity of all the fraud detection models adopted in the study.\n\n\n\nA Powerful Predicting Model for Financial Statement Fraud Based on Optimized XGBoost Ensemble Learning Technique2\nAbstract\n\nThis study aims to develop a better Financial Statement Fraud (FSF) detection model by utilizing data from publicly available financial statements of firms in the MENA region. We develop an FSF model using a powerful ensemble technique, the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, that helps to identify fraud in a set of sample companies drawn from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The issue of class imbalance in the dataset is addressed by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm. We use different Machine Learning techniques in Python to predict FSF, and our empirical findings show that the XGBoost algorithm outperformed the other algorithms in this study, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Random Forest (RF). We then optimize the XGBoost algorithm to obtain the best result, with a final accuracy of 96.05% in the detection of FSF.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nIt is highly recommended that you build your website using .ipynb files and NOT .qmdfiles\nFunctionally the two formats are basically identical, i.e. they are just Markdown + Code\nHowever there is ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE, i.e. .ipynb stores the code outputs in the meta-data of the file\n\nThis means you ONLY HAVE TO RUN THE CODE ONCE with .ipynb\n.qmd will run the code every time you build the website, which can be very slow\n\nThere are caching options for .qmd, however, they are “messier” that just using .ipynb\n\nNote: .qmd is fine if there is no code, in which case it is basically just a Markdown file\n\nConverting between the two\n\nYou can switch between the two formats using\nquarto convert clustering.qmd this will output a .ipynb version called clustering.ipynb\nquarto convert eda.ipynb this will output a .qmd version called eda.qmd\n\nYOU CAN RUN R CODE IN VSC WITH .ipynb, see the following link\n\nhttps://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-jupyter-r-kernel-with-visual-studio-code/\n\nIt is possible, but NOT RECOMMENDED, to mix Python and R code in the same file\n\nIMPORTANT ASIDE\n\nA .ipynb file is simply a JSON file with a specialized structural format\nYou can see this by running more eda/eda.ipynb from the command line\nWhich will output the following;\n\n\nTIP FOR MAC USERS\n\ncommand+control+shift+4 is very useful on a mac.\n\nIt takes a screenshot and saves it to the clip-board\n\nThe following VSC extension allows you to paste images from the clip-board with alt+command+v.\n\ntab is your best friend when using the command line, since it does auto-completion\nopen ./path_to_file will open any file or directory from the command line"
