## Topics Introduction
* `Summary`
  
   Over the decades, Apple's products are always the most popular products in the markets. However, with more and more new products introduced to the market. Are Apple products, especially iphone, are still popular in the market? How people's reaction to this brand? Postive or negative? How does Apple perform compared with its competitors? How can we predict the popularity of Apple's new product? In this project, we can dig into those problems, with the full data science cycle, we can use data to answer those questions.

* `Importance`
  
   Why should we focus on Apple? 
   Since its launch in 2007, the iPhone has had a huge impact on both technology and culture. Since it has affected and influenced a generation, everyone is interested in learning about Apple's recent performance. It is a valuable subject for study because of its influence on mobile technology, communication norms, and consumer behavior.
* `Why the reader should read this project`

   Users of iPhones may exhibit decisions and preferences that are indicative of larger patterns in consumer behavior. Through this research subject, users can select better items and observe how other consumers respond to Apple's offerings.

* `what work had done`
  
   The researchers had done many data collection, data preprocessing, and set up machine learning models to do the logistic regression, decision trees and random forest, etc. They also had done so many behavioral analysis to analyze the popularity trend for electronic products.
* `what are the “different points of views”/interpretations in the literature`
  
  Some literature emphasizes Apple's commitment to innovation and high-quality products as a key factor in its popularity. This view holds that the company's focus on design, user experience, and robust performance drives consumer preference. Some authors also discuss Apple's cultural impact, suggesting that its products have become more than just technology but a part of modern culture.[^1] 

* `What need to be explored in this topic`: 
  
  1. We can explore how people evaluate an electronic products as a good products.
  2. We can explore the stock market for the Apple Products and how it stock prices changes
  3. We can collect customers' review/news on Apple products, to see how everyone like apple's products.

* `Goals and Hypothesis`
  
   The purpose of this study is to determine whether Apple products are still in demand and to ascertain how the general public feels about the company's latest offerings. In addition, I'd like to know what specifications a mobile phone should have in order to draw in customers. So that when the next generation of iPhones came out, I could use this model to predict its popularity, I should train some models that can predict a product's popularity based on its functions.

## 2. 10 questions to address
* Can customer reviews and sentiment analysis on social media reflect the public's reaction to the products?
* How does Apple's stock performed?
* What are the trends in iPhone stocks sale volume over the last decade? 
* What kind of electronic products can be seem as a good product to buy?
* How does the pricing of Apple products compare with competitors over time, and what is the impact on market share and consumer choice?
* How can we predict whether Apple's products would be popular in the future?
* Can we use machine learning to identify key factors that predict an Apple product's popularity based on historical data?
* What kind of models we can used to predict people's attitude with reviews?
* Can decision tree analysis help in identifying whether a product is a successful mobile phone product?
* How can we eliminate the unnecessary feature for predicting the Apple's products?

### A comparative study of online consumer reviews of Apple iPhone across Amazon, Twitter and MouthShut platforms[^1]

`Abstract`

* The goal of this study is to create a classification system for online customer reviews by examining the differences in these evaluations across various internet platforms and identifying their distinctive features. It uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The study discovers that reviews of e-commerce websites cover a greater variety of subjects. Specialized review sites, on the other hand, offer reviews that are more in-depth but cover fewer subjects. Social media reviews find a middle ground between these two extremes. The examination reveals recurring motifs and broad meta-themes in these assessments. A system of classification for the reviews is devised on the basis of these insights, linking the reasons for the reviews from every platform to the recognized meta-themes. This study provides business managers with useful information to enhance their online review tactics.

### The influence of brand popularity, perceived quality, price, and need on purchase intention iPhone products in Purwokerto[^2]

`Abstract`

* This study, which is survey-based, aims to investigate how consumer needs, perceived quality, price, and brand popularity affect the decision of Purwokerto City residents to buy iPhone products. Purposive sampling was used to choose a sample of 120 people for the study. Data analysis showed that brand popularity may potentially have a negative effect on purchase intentions, not a major one. Price, on the other hand, has a negative impact on buying intentions. However, the intention to purchase is positively influenced by both perceived quality and consumer necessity. One important finding from this study is that purchase intentions are not always influenced by brand popularity. Rather, the most significant element influencing purchase intentions is shown to be consumer need.

## Next Steps:
To complete this research topic, I need to find datasets and related information related to people's reviews that reflect people's actual reaction related to Apple brands and iPhone Products. Also, I need to find some datasets that can help me to research what kind of quality of functions that would attract a customer to purchase. Whether Apple products perform well in those functions area? After I collected the datasets, I need to clean them as needed and prepare for the future model use and data analysis process.

All the code can be found in the code tab and data can be found in the data tab. The followings are some process that I will do in this process, and each topic can be found in each tab.
