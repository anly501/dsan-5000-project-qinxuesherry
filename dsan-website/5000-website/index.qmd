* what work had done: The researchers had done many data collection, data preprocessing, and set up machine learning models to do the logistic regression, decision trees and random forest, etc. They also had done so many behavioral analysis to analyze the popularity trend for electronic products.
* what are the “different points of views”/interpretations in the literature: Some literature emphasizes Apple's commitment to innovation and high-quality products as a key factor in its popularity.

### A comparative study of online consumer reviews of Apple iPhone across Amazon, Twitter and MouthShut platforms[^1] 
[^1]: Kundu, Supratim, and Swapnajit Chakraborti. “A Comparative Study of Online Consumer Reviews of Apple IPhone across Amazon, Twitter and MouthShut Platforms.” Electronic Commerce Research, vol. 22, no. 3, 2022, pp. 925–50, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10660-020-09429-w.

`Abstract`

* 
The purpose of the paper is to understand if the online consumer reviews differ across the review platforms over the internet. We aim to find the features of the reviews from various platforms and ultimately create a typology of the reviews for those platforms. We apply mixed methods including both quantitative and qualitative techniques to arrive at the conclusion. We find consumers share their views on the highest number of topics in the ecommerce website. Consumers share in-depth views, but on a limited number of topics in other dedicated review platforms. Social media falls somewhere in the middle among these two platforms. While looking into the contents, we could generate themes and meta-themes from these reviews. Based on these facts, we create a typology/ontology for reviews from these platforms and map the motives of reviewers from each platform into the meta-themes identified. Managers can use our findings to boost their online review strategy according to the platform of their interest.

### The influence of brand popularity, perceived quality, price, and need on purchase intention iPhone products in Purwokerto[^2]

`Abstract`

* This study is a survey research that aims to determine and analyze the effect of brand popularity, perceived quality, price, and need on purchase intentions on iPhone products at Purwokerto city. The sample size in this study amounted to 120 using purposive sampling technique. Based on the results of data processing, it is known that brand popularity has no significant and negative effect on purchase intention. Price has a significant and negative effect on purchase intention. Perceived quality and need have a significant and positive effect on purchase intention. The findings in this study are that popularity is not always a consumer factor in generating purchase intentions, while the factor that has the greatest influence on purchase intentions is need.

`HIGHLY RECOMMENDED` 

* It is `highly recommended` that you build your website using `.ipynb` files and NOT `.qmd`files
* Functionally the two formats are basically identical, i.e. they are just `Markdown` + `Code` 
* However there is `ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE`, i.e. `.ipynb` stores the code outputs in the meta-data of the file
  * This means you `ONLY HAVE TO RUN THE CODE ONCE` with `.ipynb`
  * `.qmd` will run the code every time you build the website, which can be very slow
    * There are `caching` options for `.qmd`, however, they are "messier" that just using `.ipynb`
  * **Note**: `.qmd` is fine if there is no code, in which case it is basically just a `Markdown` file
* Converting between the two
  * You can switch between the two formats using 
  * `quarto convert clustering.qmd` this will output a `.ipynb` version called `clustering.ipynb`
  * `quarto convert eda.ipynb` this will output a `.qmd` version called `eda.qmd`
* YOU CAN RUN `R CODE` IN VSC WITH `.ipynb`, see the following link 
  * [https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-jupyter-r-kernel-with-visual-studio-code/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-jupyter-r-kernel-with-visual-studio-code/)
* It is possible, but `NOT RECOMMENDED`, to mix Python and R code in the same file


`IMPORTANT ASIDE`

*  A `.ipynb` file is simply a `JSON` file with a specialized structural format
*  You can see this by running `more eda/eda.ipynb` from the command line
* Which will output the following;

`TIP FOR MAC USERS`

* `command+control+shift+4` is very useful on a mac. 
  * It takes a screenshot and saves it to the clip-board 
* The following VSC extension allows you to paste images from the clip-board with `alt+command+v`.

* `tab` is your best friend when using the command line, since it does `auto-completion` 
* `open ./path_to_file` will open any file or directory from the command line
